Hello everyone. Welcome to the last video of module 1 of Artificial Neural Networks.
In module 1, we built the conceptual foundation for everything that follows in this course.
We positioned neural networks within the broader landscape of artificial intelligence and machine learning and saw why deep learning works so well today.
We developed an intuitive understanding of artificial neurons, weights, bias and layers and how these elements combine to form feed-forward neural networks.
We also explored where neural networks are used in real-world systems and why shallow models face fundamental limitations.
Conceptually, this entire module can be seen as one continuous flow.
We moved from AI to machine learning to deep learning.
Then we moved from a single artificial neuron to weights and bias, from neurons to layers and from layers to feed-forward networks.
This flow captures the big picture of how modern neural network models are constructed from extremely simple building blocks.
We also discussed how feed-forward networks power so many real-world applications.
The most important intuitions you should retain from this module are
A single neuron is only a simple pattern detector.
Weights determine the feature importance.
Bias controls the baseline activation.
Layers create hierarchies of abstraction.
And depth is essential for capturing complex real-world structure.
Feed-forward networks built from these ideas form the foundation of modern neural networks.
With the conceptual foundation from this module in place, we are now ready to move into the mathematical core of neural networks.
In the next module, we will build the precise tools needed to train neural networks effectively.
We will study the linear algebra that underlines neural computations, understand how computational graphs represent complex functions,
and use the chain rule to systematically compute gradients through multilayer networks.
So, in the next module, we shift from what neural networks are to how neural networks actually learn from the data.
Thank you.
Thank you.
