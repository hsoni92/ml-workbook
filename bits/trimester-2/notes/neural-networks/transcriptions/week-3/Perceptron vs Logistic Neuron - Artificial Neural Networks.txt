Hello everyone. Welcome back to module 3 of artificial neural networks. In this video, we will compare the logistic neuron with the perceptron. By the end of this video, you will be able to compare hard versus smooth activation in perceptron and logistic neuron. You will interpret class labels versus probabilities in the model outputs. And you will
understand why logistic neurons are preferred in practice. At a high level, both the models, perceptron and logistic neuron, compute exactly the same linear score. Z equals W transpose X plus D. So, the underlying geometry, the line or the hyperplane defined by this expression, is identical in both the cases. The fundamental difference lies entirely in what we do after computing.
The single change, the activation function, completely changes the nature of the output, the interpretation of predictions, and how learning is later performed. The perceptron applies a hard threshold to the score using the sine function. As soon as the score crosses zero, the output jumps abruptly from one class to the other. The logistic neuron, in contrast, applies the sigmoid function.
Instead of an abrupt jump, the output, now transitions smoothly from zero to one as the score increases.
Now, let's look at the graphs of these two functions. For the sine function or step function as we call it, for the negative values, its value is minus one. At zero, it becomes zero. And for the positive values, it abruptly changes to plus one. So, this is the sine or
or step function. Now let's look at the curve for the sigmoid function. It is an S-shaped curve
which looks something like this. At the value of 0, its value becomes 0.5. For large positive
values, its value tends to plus 1 and for large negative values, its value tends to 0. If you
look at these two graphs, you can clearly see the contrast. The step function switches instantly while the sigmoid changes gradually. This single mathematical change transforms a hard classifier into a soft probabilistic classifier. This difference in activation leads to a fundamental difference in how we interpret the output. For the perceptron, the output is strictly one of the two values, typically,
minus 1 or plus 1. It is simply a class label with no indication of how confident the model is. For the logistic neuron, the output lies in the continuous interval between 0 and 1. This value can be interpreted as a probability, y hat equals probability y equals 1 given x. This means the logistic neuron does not just tell us which class it predicts, it also
also tells us how confident it is in that prediction. An important and sometimes surprising
fact is that despite these major differences in output behavior, the decision boundary
itself does not change. For both the perceptron and the logistic neuron, the decision boundary
is given by W transpose X plus B equals 0. This means that geometrically, both models
still produce a linear boundary in the input space. The line or hyperplane separating the
classes is the same in both cases. What changes is not where the boundary is, but how the output
behaves in the neighborhood of that boundary. The phrase smooth decision boundary does not mean
the boundary itself becomes curved. The boundary is still linear. What becomes smooth is the transition
output across the boundary. So let's say if we have a decision boundary which looks something
like this. For the points which are very near to this decision boundary. Points like this.
The output of the perceptron jumps instantly from one class to the other. So for these points, the
perceptron will say plus 1 and for these points the perceptron might say minus 1. So there is an abrupt change in the output in case of the perceptron. While in case of the logistic neuron, right?
For similar such points, the output probability is going to be somewhere close to 0.5. Which means that the model is not very sure about the class. The model explicitly represents uncertainty near the boundary rather than making an abrupt commitment. This smooth transition is what allows us to interpret predictions probabilistically. This smoothness has very important practices.
Because the output of the logical consequences. Because the output of the logistic neuron changes smoothly with the weights. It becomes possible to use continuous optimization methods to train the model. This is not possible with the perceptron's non-differentiable step function. The probabilistic output allows us to rank predictions by confidence, adjust decision thresholds depending on the application, and reason quantitatively
about uncertainty. These properties make the logistic neuron. These properties make the logistic neuron far more suitable for real-world classification problem. Let us now summarize the differences between the two models. Both the perceptron and the logistic neuron use the same linear score function. The perceptron applies a hard step, produces only binary outputs, and gives no measure of confidence. The logistic neuron applies a sigmoid, produces only binary outputs, and gives no measure of confidence.
The logistic neuron uses continuous outputs between 0 and 1, and allows a clear probabilistic interpretation. Both models have linear decision boundaries, but the logistic neuron replaces abrupt decisions with smooth confidence-aware decisions. And this difference is absolutely central to modern machine learning. Now, let us summarize the main points of this video. The perceptron and the logistic neuron define the logistic neuron.
The logistic neuron is the logistic neuron. The logistic neuron is the logistic neuron. The logistic neuron makes the logistic neuron. The logistic neuron makes the logistic neuron. The logistic neuron makes the logistic neuron's smooth transition across the boundary is what enables confidence estimation and stable training. This is the logistic neuron. The logistic neuron makes the logistic neuron's smooth transition across the boundary is what enables confidence estimation and stable training. This is the logistic neuron's smooth transition across the boundary is what enables confidence estimation and stable training.
This is why the logistic neuron becomes the logistic neuron becomes the logistic neuron. This is why the logistic neuron becomes the fundamental building block for modern neural networks. In the next part of the course, we will build on this foundation to study how such smooth neurons are trained and combined in multi-layer architectures. Thank you.
