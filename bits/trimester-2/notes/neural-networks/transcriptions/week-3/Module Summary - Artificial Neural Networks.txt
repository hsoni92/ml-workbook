Hello everyone. Welcome to the last video of module 3 of Artificial Neural Networks.
What did we learn in module 3? In this module, our goal was to understand the first building
blocks of neural networks. We focused on the perceptron and the logistic neuron and used
them to develop a foundational understanding of linear classification, model limitations,
and the motivation for deeper architectures. We began with the perceptron, the simplest
computational model of a neuron. The perceptron computes a linear score using a weighted sum of
inputs and a bias and then applies a hard threshold to produce a binary output. This makes the
perceptron a linear binary classifier. It works perfectly when the data is linearly separable,
but that assumption turns out to be very restrictive.
By studying the perceptron geometrically, we saw that it can draw only one straight decision
boundary in the input space. This immediately leads to a fundamental limitation. Some problems
like the ZOR classification task cannot be separated by any single straight line. The perceptron fails on
such problems not because of poor learning, but because of a structural limitation of the model itself.
We then saw how this limitation can be overcome by changing the architecture, not just the neuron.
By introducing a hidden layer, a network can create multiple linear feature splits and then recombine
them to form non-linear decision regions. This is the key representational advantage of multi-layer neural
networks over single-layer perceptrons. Finally, we introduced the logistic neuron which replaces the hard
threshold of the perceptron with a smooth sigmoid function. This gives us continuous outputs that can
be interpreted as probabilities, enabling confidence-aware predictions. To summarize the big picture of this module, we move from the perceptron as a basic linear classifier, to its geometric
limitations shown by ZOR, to the architectural motivation for hidden layers, and finally to the logistic neuron as a smooth probabilistic building block of modern neural networks. In the next module, we will build on this foundation to study the architecture of multi-layer perceptrons. How hidden layers and forward paths work? We will delve deeper into the concept of non-linearity and activation functions and some
associated practical issues. See you all in the next module. Thank you.
