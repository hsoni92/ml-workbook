Hello everyone, welcome to module 2 of Artificial Neural Networks. In this video, we will discuss why we need the mathematical foundation for neural networks.
In module 1, we focused on building a conceptual foundation for neural networks. We understood what neurons are, how layers are formed, how feed-forward networks work, and where neural networks are used in real-world systems.
However, one very important question remains, which is, how do neural networks actually learn from the data?
To answer that, we must shift from concepts to mathematics. Neural network learning is fundamentally driven by linear algebra, calculus, and systematic gradient computation.
This module exists to give you the exact mathematical tools required to understand and implement neural network training.
Coming to what you will learn this week? In this module, we will build the mathematical foundations step by step.
We will begin with the linear algebra essentials used in neural networks like vectors, matrices, tensors, dot products, and matrix operations.
Then, we will move to gradients and derivatives, including partial derivatives and gradient vectors for multivariate functions.
Next, we will study the chain rule, which is the key mathematical mechanism that allows gradients to flow through multilayer neural networks.
Finally, we will cover numerical stability, which explains why training can fail due to overflow and underflow, and how practical systems avoid these issues.
This module serves as a critical bridge between understanding what neural networks are and understanding how they actually learn.
Without the tools from this module, it is impossible to properly understand back propagation, multilayer learning, loss minimization, and deep learning optimization.
Everything that follows later in this course, from simple perceptrons to deep neural architectures, will rely directly on the mathematics you learn here.
So, how to approach this module?
This module will be slightly more mathematical than the previous one, but you are not expected to memorize formulas.
Instead, your goal should be to understand what each mathematical object represents, build some geometric intuition around it, and connect every equation to what the neural network is actually doing.
If some calculus or linear algebra feels rusty, this module is designed as a targeted refresher, focused only on what neural networks truly use.
So, please don't worry, we will be covering all the required concepts here.
This module will actually make all the future topics easier.
So, my advice to you all would be to spend enough time on this module.
Thank you.
