Hello everyone, welcome to the last video of module 2 of Artificial Neural Networks. So, what did we learn in module 2? In this module, we focused on building the mathematical foundation needed to understand neural networks in a precise way.
The emphasis was on linear algebra, calculus and numerical computation, not on specific models yet. We started with linear algebra, we discussed vectors, matrices, dot products and matrix operations which form the language in which neural network computations are expressed. Then, we moved to derivatives and partial derivatives to measure how outputs change when inputs or parameters change.
From there, we introduced the gradient vector as a compact way to collect all these sensitivities. Finally, we studied the chain rule which tells us how sensitivities propagate through compositions of functions and intermediate variables.
We also discussed numerical stability and how techniques like the log sum exponential trick help keep the computation stable which is essential for any practical neural network implementation.
With this mathematical toolkit in place, we are now ready to study our first concrete neural models. In the next module, we will introduce the perceptron as a simple linear classifier, explore linear separability and the classic XOR limitation and then move to the logistic neuron. This will connect the math you have learned here to actual neural decision making and prepare you for multi-layer neural network.
So, see you all in the next module. Thank you.
