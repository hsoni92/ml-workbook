# Perceptron and Logistic Neuron – Artificial Neural Networks (Module 3 Introduction)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module you will:

1. **Understand** the Perceptron as a linear classifier and its geometric decision boundaries.
2. **Study** how the Perceptron learns from data and the idea of **linear separability** and the **XOR** problem.
3. **Introduce** the Logistic Neuron as a smooth, probabilistic building block.
4. **Explain** why multi-layer neural networks are necessary.

## From Mathematics to Models

- In **Module 2** we focused on the **mathematical foundations** of learning: vectors, derivatives, gradients, chain rule, and numerical stability.
- In **Module 3** we move from **pure mathematics** to the **first actual neural models**: the **Perceptron** and the **Logistic Neuron** (Sigmoid Neuron).
- These are the simplest units that perform **real decision-making** in neural systems.

## What This Module Covers

| Topic | What You Will Learn |
|-------|----------------------|
| **Perceptron** | How it works as a **linear classifier**; how its decisions can be understood **geometrically** (decision boundaries). |
| **Perceptron learning** | How the Perceptron **learns from data** (learning rule). |
| **Linear separability and XOR** | When a single line can separate classes; the **XOR problem** as a fundamental limitation of single-layer models. |
| **Logistic neuron** | **Smooth, probabilistic** outputs; why it is preferred in practice. |
| **Multi-layer motivation** | Why we need **hidden layers** and deeper architectures. |

## Role of This Module

- **Bridge:** From the **mathematical tools** (Module 2) to **concrete models** and their limitations.
- Once you understand the Perceptron and the Logistic Neuron, the step to **deeper networks** becomes **conceptually natural** and well motivated.

## Summary

This module builds the **first building blocks** of neural networks: linear classification (Perceptron), its geometric limits (XOR), and a smooth probabilistic alternative (Logistic Neuron) that leads into multi-layer architectures.
