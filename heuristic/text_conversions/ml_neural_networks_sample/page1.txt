Introduction to Machine Learning and Neural Networks
1. Introduction to Machine Learning
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make
decisions without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing algorithms that can access
data and use it to learn for themselves.
The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or
instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the
examples that we provide.
2. What Are Neural Networks?
Neural networks are a set of algorithms, modeled loosely after the human brain, that are designed to
recognize patterns. They interpret sensory data through machine perception, labeling, and
clustering of raw input.
A neural network consists of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers. Each connection
between neurons has a weight that determines the strength of the connection. During training, these
weights are adjusted to minimize the difference between predicted and actual outputs.
3. Key Components of Neural Networks
- Input Layer: Receives the initial data
- Hidden Layers: Process the data through weighted connections
- Output Layer: Produces the final result
- Weights: Determine connection strength between neurons
- Bias: Adds flexibility to the model
- Activation Functions: Introduce non-linearity
