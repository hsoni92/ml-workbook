What is the Water Cycle?  
The water cycle is a way that water moves all around the Earth. It never stops, it does 
not have a beginning or an end. It's like a big circle!  
 
 
Did you know? 
 The water cycle is also known as the “hydrologic cycle”  
 Earth has been recycling water for over 4 billion years! 
 Do plants sweat? Well, sort of....  People perspire (sweat) and plants transpire.  
Transpiration is the process by which plants lose water out of their leaves.
