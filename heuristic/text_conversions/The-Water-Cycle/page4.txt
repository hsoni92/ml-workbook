Precipitation occurs when so much water has condensed that the air cannot hold it 
anymore.  The clouds get heavy and water falls back to the earth in the form of rain, 
hail, sleet or snow. 
 
 
4) Collection/Storage  
A lot of the Earth's water does not take part in the water cycle very often. Much of it 
is stored. The Earth stores water in a number of places. The ocean is the largest 
storage of water. Around 96% of the Earth's water is stored in the ocean. We can't 
drink the salty ocean water, so fortunately for us, freshwater is also stored in lakes, 
glaciers, snow caps, rivers, and below the ground in groundwater storage.
