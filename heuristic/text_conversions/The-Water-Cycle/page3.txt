Convection in the water cycle is when the air near the surface is heated, then rises 
taking heat with it. Water vapour in the air gets cold and changes back into liquid, 
forming clouds. This is called condensation. 
 
 
 
You can see the same sort of thing at home...  Pour a glass of cold water on a hot day 
and watch what happens.  Water forms on the outside of the glass.  That water 
didn't somehow leak through the glass!  It actually came from the air. Water vapour 
in the warm air, turns back into liquid when it touches the cold glass!
