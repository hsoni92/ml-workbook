 
 
So how can we understand this magical process called the water cycle?  
There are four main parts to the water cycle: Evaporation, Convection, Precipitation 
and Collection. 
1) Evaporation 
Evaporation is when the sun heats up water in rivers or lakes or the ocean and turns 
it into vapour or steam. The water vapour or steam leaves the river, lake or ocean 
and goes into the air.  
 
We have already learnt about transpiration, did you know that transpiration gives 
evaporation a bit of a hand in getting the water vapour back up into the air!
