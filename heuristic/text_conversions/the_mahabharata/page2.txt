PART ONE: THE GAME OF DICE  
In the first two books of the Mahabharata, we learn the background of the 
Bharatas (also called the Kurus) leading up to the conflict between the five sons 
of Pandu and their cousins the Kauravas. This story is told by the sage Vyasa, 
whose name came to mean the “compiler.” (Actually, the author of the epic is 
unknown, probably many authors over centuries.) Vyasa's mother is Satyavati, 
whose name means truth, so he is the “son of truth.” In telling his story to a 
descendant of the Pandavas, Vyasa says, “If you listen carefully, at the end you’ll 
be someone else.” (play) Vyasa appears infrequently throughout the story, giving 
advice and also fathering Pandu and Dhritarashtra.
