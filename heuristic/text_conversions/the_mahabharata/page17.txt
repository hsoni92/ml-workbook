or not? Drona will lay down his arms the day an honest man lies. Krishna tells 
Yudhishthira: “Under such circumstances, falsehood is preferable to truth. By 
telling a lie to save a life, one is not touched by sin” (CN 157). Yudhishthira 
speaks a half-lie, “Ashvatthama – (and muttering under his breath) the elephant – 
is dead.” Before his lie, Yudhishthira's chariot rode four inches off the ground, 
but now it sinks back to earth. Drona lays down his arms. Drupada's son 
Dhrishtadyumna cuts off Drona's head, having sworn to avenge his father's 
humiliation.  
Meanwhile Bhima sees Duhsasana coming towards him. Bhima had sworn to 
drink the blood of this avowed enemy for what he had done to Draupadi. Bhima 
knocks Duhsasana to the ground with his mace and rips open his chest. He 
drinks his blood, saying that it tastes better than his mother’s milk. Bhima, who 
kills many Rakshasa (and has a son by one), often acts like the man-eating ogres 
himself—the bloody deaths of Kicaka and Duhsasana, both to avenge Draupadi; 
Bhima is her most passionate defender. Bhima kills most of the 100 Kauravas, 
who were demons incarnate.
