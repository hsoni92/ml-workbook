The Mahabharata (composed between 300 BC and 300 AD) has the honor of being 
the longest epic in world literature, 100,000 2-line stanzas (although the most 
recent critical edition edits this down to about 88,000), making it eight times as 
long as Homer's Iliad and Odyssey together, and over 3 times as long as the Bible 
(Chaitanya vii). According to the Narasimhan version, only about 4000 lines relate 
to the main story; the rest contain additional myths and teachings. In other 
words, the Mahabharata resembles a long journey with many side roads and 
detours. It is said that “Whatever is here is found elsewhere. But whatever is not 
here is nowhere else.” 
The name means “great [story of the] Bharatas.” Bharata was an early ancestor of 
both the Pandavas and Kauravas who fight each other in a great war, but the 
word is also used generically for the Indian race, so the Mahabharata sometimes 
is referred to as “the great story of India.” 
The work is divided into 18 books (concerning an 18-day war among 18 armies). 
The main narrative concerning the war is contained in the first ten books.
