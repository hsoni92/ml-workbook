The Kauravas have eleven divisions to stand against the seven of the Pandavas. 
The two armies are described as two oceans, crashing against each other. Briefly 
it’s described as a “beautiful sight” (CN 125-6). Kunti tells the narrator Vyasa (in 
play): “You find too much beauty in men’s death. Blood decorates your poem, 
and the cries of the dying are your music.”  
Bad omens appear prior to battle as thousands of carrion birds gather “crying in 
glee” (KD 539). Karna prophesies that his side will lose, that this is nothing but “a 
great sacrifice of arms” with Krishna as high priest.  
Both sides agree to abide by certain rules of war: no fighting humans with 
celestial weapons, no fighting at night, do not strike someone who's retreating or 
unarmed, or on the back or legs. All these rules will eventually be broken.  
 
Just as the battle is about to start, Arjuna falters at the sight of his relatives and 
teachers, now his sworn enemies. He breaks down and refuses to fight. “How can 
any good come from killing one’s own relatives? What value is victory if all our 
friends and loved ones are killed? … We will be overcome by sin if we slay such 
aggressors. Our proper duty is surely to forgive them. Even if they have lost sight
