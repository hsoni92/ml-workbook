Yudhishthira has a 
vision of the age to 
come: “I see the 
coming of another 
age, where barbaric 
kings rule over a 
vicious, broken 
world; where puny, 
fearful, hard men live 
tiny lives, white hair 
at sixteen, copulating 
with animals, their 
women perfect 
whores, making love 
with greedy mouths. 
The cows dry, trees 
stunted, no more 
flowers, no more purity; ambition, corruption, the age of Kali, the black time” 
(play).  
Bhima asks, why has he come this far only to quit, like a man climbing a honey 
tree but refusing to taste it, or a man in bed with a woman but refusing to make 
love? Draupadi questions his manhood, as only eunuchs seek tranquility and 
avoid violence. Arjuna says refusing to rule will only cause more disorder and 
create for him great amount of bad karma to face in next life of lowly birth. We 
should accept our role depending on where we are in life: a father has obligation 
to his family while they are young, likewise a king must first rule, then in the last 
years of life he may abandon the world, but to do so earlier would be an act of 
selfishness.  
In his dying speech, pierced by many arrows, Bhishma tells Yudhishthira that in 
the fourth age (our present age), “dharma becomes adharma and adharma, 
dharma.” Somewhat paradoxically, he continues, “If one fights against trickery, 
one should oppose him with trickery. But if one fights lawfully, one should check 
him with dharma ... One should conquer evil with good. Death by dharma is better 
than victory by evil deeds.”  
Bhishma's dying advice to Yudhishthira lasts 50 days and covers two of the 
longest books in the epic (12-13); some of the topics: 
• 
"There is no duty higher than Truth," but five falsehoods are not sinful: 
lying in jest, lying to a woman, lying at wedding, lying to save a teacher, 
lying to save one's life. 
• 
The foremost duty of kings is to revere Brahmins.
