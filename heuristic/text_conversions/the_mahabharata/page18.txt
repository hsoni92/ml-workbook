The Death of Karna
Duryodhana asks Karna to avenge his brother Duhsasana, and he finally meets 
Arjuna in the decisive confrontation.  
  
Arjuna and Karna both have celestial weapons (for example, one shoots arrows 
of fire to be quenched by arrows of water). Karna has an arrow possessed by a 
Naga (serpent) spirit who holds a grudge against Arjuna (his family had died in 
the forest consumed by Agni). When Karna shoots at Arjuna, his charioteer warns 
him that his aim is too high, but he refuses to listen, and hits Arjuna's coronet 
only. When the spirit-possessed arrow returns to him and says try again, this 
time he will not miss, Karna won't admit failure by shooting the same arrow twice, 
even if he could kill 100 Arjunas.
