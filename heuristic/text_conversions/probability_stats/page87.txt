3.Paired t- test ( Test the significance of the difference between means of two dependent 
samples ) : 
Paired observations arise in many practical situations where each homogenous experimental unit 
receives both population condition. 
For Example: To test the effectiveness of ‘drug’ some // person’s blood pressure is measured 
before and after the intake of certain drug. Here the individual person is the experimental unit and 
the two populations are blood pressure “before” and “after” the drug is given 
Paired t-test is applied for n paired observations by taking the differences d1,d2 ------dn of the paired 
data. To test whether the differences di from a random sample of a population with mean 𝜇.

Problems: 
1. A sample of 26 bulbs gives a mean life of 990 hours with a S.D of 20 hours. The 
manufacturer claims that the mean life of bulbs is 1000 hours . Is the sample not upto 
the standard? 
Sol: Given n = 26 
𝑥̅ = 990 
𝜇 = 1000 and S.D i.e., s = 20 
i) 
Null Hypothesis : 𝐻଴ : 𝜇 = 1000 
ii) 
Alternative Hypothesis:𝐻ଵ : 𝜇<1000( Left one tailed test )  
(Since it is given  below standard) 
iii) 
Level of significance :𝛼= 0.05   
t  tabulated value  with 25 degrees of freedom for left tailed test is 1.708

Conclusion: Since |𝑡௖௔௟|value>𝑡ఈvalue , we reject  𝐻଴  
Hence we conclude that the sample is not upto the standard. 
 
2. A random sample of size 16 values from a normal population showed a mean of 53 and 
sum of squares of deviations from the mean equals to 150 . Can this sample be regarded 
as taken from the population having 56 as mean ? Obtain 95% confidence limits of the 
mean of the population.? 
Sol: a) Given n = 16 
𝑥̅ = 53 
 𝜇 = 56 and ∑(𝑥௜−𝑥̅)ଶ = 150
