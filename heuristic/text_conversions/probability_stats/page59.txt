Classification of Samples: 
 Large Samples : If the size of the sample  n ≥30 , then it is said to be large sample. 
 Small Samples : If the size of the sample n < 30 ,then it is said to be small sample or 
exact sample. 
Parameters and Statistics: 
Parameter is a statistical measure based on all the units of a population. Statistic is a statistical 
measure based on only the units selected in a sample. 
Note: In this unit, Parameter refers to the population and Statistic refers to sample. 
Central Limit Theorem:  
If 𝑥̅ be the mean of a random sample of size n drawn from population having mean 𝜇 and standard 
deviation 𝜎 , then the sampling distribution of the sample mean 𝑥̅ is approximately a normal 
distribution with mean 𝜇 and SD = S.E of 𝑥̅ =

Standard Error of a Statistic: The standard error of statistic ‘t’ is the standard deviation          of 
the sampling distribution of the statistic i.e, S.E of sample mean is the standard deviation           of 
the sampling distribution of sample mean. 
Formulae for S.E:

Estimation :To use the statistic obtained by the samples as an estimate to predict the unknown 
parameter of the population from which the sample is drawn. 
Estimate : An estimate is a statement made to find an unknown population parameter. 
Estimator : The procedure or rule to determine an unknown population parameter is called  
estimator. 
Example: Sample proportion is an estimate of population proportion , because with the help of 
sample proportion value we can estimate the population proportion value. 
Types of Estimation: 
 Point Estimation: If the estimate of the population parameter is given by a single value , 
then the estimate is called a point estimation of the parameter. 
 Interval Estimation: If the estimate of the population parameter is given by two different 
values between which the parameter may be considered to lie, then the estimate is called 
an interval estimation of the parameter. 
Confidence interval Estimation of parameters: 
     In an interval estimation of the population parameter 𝜃, if we can find two quantities 𝑡ଵand 𝑡ଶ 
     based on sample observations drawn from the population such that the unknown parameter 𝜃 
     is included in the interval [𝑡ଵ,𝑡ଶ] in a specified cases ,then this is called a confidence interval  
     for the parameter 𝜃. 
Confidence Limits for Population mean 𝝁 
 95% confidence limits are 𝑥̅ ±  1.96 (𝑆. 𝐸. 𝑜𝑓 𝑥 ഥ) 
 99% confidence limits are 𝑥̅ ±  2.58 (𝑆. 𝐸. 𝑜𝑓 𝑥 ഥ) 
 99.73% confidence limits are 𝑥̅ ±  3 (𝑆. 𝐸. 𝑜𝑓 𝑥 ഥ) 
 90% confidence limits are 𝑥̅ ±  1.645 (𝑆. 𝐸. 𝑜𝑓 𝑥 ഥ)
