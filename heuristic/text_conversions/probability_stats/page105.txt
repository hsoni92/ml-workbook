ASSIGNMENT QUESTIONS 
 
  1. A random sample of 500 items has mean 20 and another sample of size 400 has mean 15.    
    Can you conclude that the two samples are taken from the same population with SD as 4. 
2. A sample of 500 products are examined from a factory and 5% found to be defective. 
Another sample of 400 similar products are examined and 3% found to be defective. Test 
the significance between the difference of two proportions at 5% LOS. 
 
3. 20 people were attacked by a disease and only 18 survived .will you reject the hypothesis 
that the survival rate of the attack by this disease is 85% in favor of the hypothesis that is 
more at 5% LOS 
 
 
4. Ten specimens of copper wires drawn from a large lot have the following breaking 
strength(in kg) 518,572,570,568,572,578,572,569,548.Test whether the mean breaking 
strengths of the lot may be taken to be 518 kg weight.
