OBJECTIVES 
 
1. To understand a random variable that describes randomness or an 
 
 uncertainty in certain realistic situations which can be either discrete or  
 
continuous type. 
 
2. To learn functions of multiple random variables through joint distributions 
 
 since the random situations are described as functions of multiple random  
 
variables. 
 
               OUTCOME: 
                  Describe randomness in certain realistic situation which can be either 
 
                  discrete orcontinuous type.
