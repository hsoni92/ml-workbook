6.A manufacturer of television set known that on an average 5% of their product is   
     defective. They sell television sets in consignment of 100 and guarantees that not more     
     than 2 set will be defective. What is the probability that the TV set will fail to meet the 
     guaranteed quality? 
Sol: The probability of TV Set to be defective = p = 5% =0.05 
       Total number of TV sets , n = 100 
 
     ⸫Mean, λ =np = 100(0.05) = 5

       P (a TV set will fail to meet the guarantee) = P(X>2) = 1-P (X≤ 2)

NORMAL DISTRIBUTION (GAUSSIAN DISTRIBUTION) 
Let X be a continuous random variable, then it is said to follow normal distribution if its pdf is 
given by 
  𝑓 (𝑥, 𝜇, 𝜎) =
ଵ
ఙ√ଶగ𝑒ିభ
మቀೣషഋ
഑ቁ
మ
,−∞≤𝑥≤∞, 𝜇, 𝜎>0 
Here , 𝜎 are the mean & S.D of X. 
Properties Of Normal Distribution 
1. Normal curve is always centered at mean 
2. Mean, median and mode coincide (i.e., equal) 
3. It is unimodal 
4. It is a symmetrical curve and bell shaped curve
