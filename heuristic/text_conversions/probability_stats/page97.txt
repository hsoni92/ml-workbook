Snedecor’s F- Test of Significance 
The F-Distribution is also called as Variance Ratio Distribution as it usually defines the ratio 
of the variances of the two normally distributed populations. The F-distribution got its name after 
the name of R.A. Fisher, who studied this test for the first time in 1924. 
Symbolically, the quantity is distributed as F-distribution with and degrees of freedom 𝜗ଵ= 𝑛ଵ−
