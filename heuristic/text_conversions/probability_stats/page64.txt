Sample size = n .let n= 𝑛ଵ=800

When 𝑛ଵis reduced to 200 
let n= 𝑛ଶ=200 
Then S.Eଶ =

ଵ଴√ଶ 
∴ S.Eଶ =

ଵ଴√ଶ = 2ቀ
ఙ
ଶ଴√ଶቁ = 2 (S.𝐸ଵ) 
Hence if sample size is reduced from 800to 200, S. E. of mean will be multiplied by 2 
4.The variance of a population is 2 . The size of the sample collected from the population is  
169. What is the standard error of mean 
Sol:  n= The size of the sample =169  
𝜎= S.D of population = √Variance  = √2 
Standard Error of mean =

5.The mean height of students in a college is 155cms and standard deviation is 15 . What is  
the probability that the mean height of 36 students is less than 157 cms. 
Sol:𝜇 = Mean of the population  
                     = Mean height of students of a college  = 155cms 
                 n =  S.D of population = 15cms  
 𝑥ഥ = mean of sample = 157 cms 
                     Now z =

∴ P ( 𝑥̅ ≤157) = P ( z< 0.8 ) = 0.5 + P ( 0 ≤ z ≤ 0.8 )  
 = 0.5 +0.2881 = 0.7881 
Thus the probability that the mean height of 36 students is less than 157 = 0.7881 
6.A random sample of size 100 is taken from a population with 𝝈 = 5.1 . Given that the  
sample mean is 𝒙ഥ = 21.6 Construct a 95% confidence limits for the population mean  . 
Sol: Given 𝑥̅ = 21.6  
𝑧ఈଶ
ൗ = 1.96, n = 100 ,𝜎 = 5.1 
∴ Confidence interval = ( 𝑥̅ −𝑧ఈଶ

Hence (20.6,22.6) is the confidence interval for the population mean 𝜇 
7.It is desired to estimate the mean time of continuous use until an answering machine will  
first require service . If it can be assumed that 𝝈 = 60 days, how large a sample is needed  
so that one will be able to assert with 90% confidence that the sample mean is off by at  
most 10 days. 
Sol: We have maximum error (E)  = 10 days , 𝜎 = 60 days and 𝑧ఈଶ
ൗ = 1.645 
∴ n = ቂ

8.A random sample of size 64 is taken from a normal population with 𝝁= 𝟓𝟏. 𝟒 and 𝝈 =  
6.8.What is the probability that the mean of the sample will  a)  exceed 52.9     b) fall  
between 50.5 and 52.3  c) be less than 50.6 
Sol: Given n = the size of the sample = 64 
𝜇 = the mean of the population = 51.4 
𝜎 = the S.D of the population = 6.8
