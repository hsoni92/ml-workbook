Hence we conclude that the data support the assumption of mean I.Q of 100 in the 
population.  
b) The 95% confidence limits of the mean of the population are given by 
𝑥 ഥ± 𝑡଴.଴ହ
ௌ
√௡ = 97.2 ± 2.26× 4.512 
                    = 97.2 ± 10.198  
                     = 107.4 and 87 
∴ 95% confidence limits are( 87, 107.4 ) 
 
4. Samples of two types of electric bulbs were tested for length of life and following data 
were obtained  
Type 1 
Type 2 
Sample number , 𝒏𝟏 = 8  
𝒏𝟐 = 7 
Sample mean  ,𝒙𝟏
തതത = 1234 
𝒙𝟐
തതത = 1036 
Sample S.D ,𝒔𝟏= 36 
𝒔𝟐= 40 
Is the difference in the mean sufficient to warrant that type 1 is superior to type 2 
regarding length of life . 
Sol: i)  Null Hypothesis 𝐻଴ : The two types of electric bulbs are identical  
i.e., 𝐻଴: 𝜇ଵ = 𝜇ଶ 
ii) Alternative Hypothesis 𝐻ଵ : 𝜇ଵ≠𝜇ଶ

2.16v)Conclusion: Since |𝑡௖௔௟| 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 >𝑡ఈ value , we reject  𝐻଴  
       Hence we conclude that the two types 1 and 2 of electric bulbs are not identical . 
5. Two horses A and B were tested according to the time to run a particular track with the 
following results . 
Horse A 
28 
30 
32 
33 
33 
29 
34 
Horse B 
29 
30 
30

Test whether the two horses have the same running capacity 
Sol: Given 𝑛ଵ = 7 ,𝑛ଶ= 6  
We first compute the sample means and standard deviations 
𝑥̅ = Mean of the first sample =

଻(219) =  31.286 
𝑦ത = Mean of the second sample =
