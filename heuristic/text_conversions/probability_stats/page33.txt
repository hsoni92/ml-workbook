5. X-axis is an  asymptote to the normal curve 
6. The total area under the normal curve from −∞ 𝑡𝑜∞ is “1” 
7. The points of inflection of the normal curve are 𝜇± 𝜎, 𝜇± 3𝜎 
8. The area of the normal curve between 
                                                               𝜇−𝜎 to 𝜇+ 𝜎  = 68.27% 
𝜇−2𝜎 𝑡𝑜 𝜇+ 2𝜎 = 95.44% 
𝜇−3𝜎 𝑡𝑜 𝜇+ 3𝜎 = 99.73% 
9.The curve for normal distribution is given below 
 
 
Standard Normal Variable 
Let 𝑍=

ఙ with mean ‘0’ and variance is ‘1’ then the normal variable is said to be standard 
normal variable. 
Standard Normal Distribution 
The normal distribution with man ‘0’ and variance ‘1’ is said to be standard normal distribution 
of its probability density function is defined by
