The following are scatter diagrams of Correlation. 
 
Karl Pearson’s Coefficient of Correlation 
Karl Pearson suggested a mathematical method for measuring the magnitude of linear relationship 
between 2 variables. This is known as Pearsonian Coefficient of correlation. It is denoted by ‘𝑟’. 
This method is also known as Product-Moment correlation coefficient

X = (x −Xഥ ) , Y = (y −Yഥ ) where, X,ഥYഥ  are means of the series 𝑥&𝑦. 
σ୶= standard deviation of series x 
σ୷=  standard deviation of series y 
Properties  
1. The Coefficient of correlation lies b/w −1&+1 . 
2. The Coefficient of correlationis independent of change of origin & scale of measurements. 
3. If X, Y are random variables and a, b, c, dare any numbers such that a ≠ 0, c ≠ 0 then  
r(aX + b, cY +  d) = ac
|ac| r(X, Y)  
4. Two independent variables are uncorrelated. That is if X and Y are independent variables then 
r(X, Y) =  0 
Rank Correlation Coefficient 
Charles Edward Spearman found out the method of finding the Coefficient of correlation by ranks. 
This method is based on rank & is useful in dealing with qualitative characteristics such as 
morality, character, intelligence and beauty. Rank correlation is applicable to only to the 
individual observations.
