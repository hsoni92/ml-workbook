16. Random samples of 400 men and 200 women in a locality were asked whether they 
would like to have a bus stop a bus stop near their residence . 200 men and 40 women 
in favor of the proposal. Test the significance between the difference of two 
proportions at 5% los? 
Sol: Let 𝑃ଵ and 𝑃ଶ  be the population proportions in a locality who favor the bus stop  
Given 𝑛ଵ = Number of men = 400 
𝑛ଶ = number of women = 200 
𝑥ଵ = Number of men in favor of the bus stop = 200 
𝑥ଶ = Number of women in favor of the bus stop 40

v) 
Conclusion: Since |Zୡୟ୪|value >Z஑value , we reject  𝐻଴  
Hence we conclude that there is difference between the men and women in their 
attitude towards the bus stop near their residence. 
 
17. A machine puts out 16 imperfect articles in a sample of 500 articles. After the 
machine is overhauled it puts out 3 imperfect articles in a sample of 100 articles. Has 
the machine is improved? 
Sol : Let  𝑃ଵ and 𝑃ଶ be the proportions of imperfect articles in the proportion of articles  
manufactured by the machine before and after overhauling , respectively. 
Given 𝑛ଵ = Sample size before the machine overhauling = 500 
𝑛ଶ = Sample size after the machine overhauling = 100 
𝑥ଵ = Number of imperfect articles before overhauling = 16 
𝑥ଶ= Number of imperfect articles after overhauling = 3
