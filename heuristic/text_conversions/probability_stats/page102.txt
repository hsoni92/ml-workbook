S  =√3.23 = 1.8 
 
We use students t test. 
1. Null hypothesis  H0 : 𝜇1 = 𝜇 2 
2. Alternate hypothesis H1 :𝜇1≠𝜇 2  ( Two tailed test) 
3. Level of significance :∝ = 0.05 
4. The test statistic is t =  (𝑥̅ −𝑦ത)/𝑆√(1/𝑛1 + 1/𝑛2) 
 
                                                = (12 −10)/1.8√(1/8 + 1/7) 
 
                                                = 2.15 
The tabulated value of t for 8+7-2 = 13 d.f at 5% los is 2.16 
Since calculated t value < tabulated t value, we accept the null hypothesis H0 and conclude that  
the difference between the means of the sample is not significant. 
 
 
5. A sample of 10 student’s marks in an Entrance test out of 150 marks is given as 70,  
    120, 110, 101, 88, 83, 95, 98, 107, 100. Test whether their mean mark is 100 at 5% los. 
 
Sol: Here mean and S.D of the data is not given. So first calculate the sample mean and S.D.

 There for S.D,  S = √203.73 
                               = 14.27 
We use students t test.
