RANDOM VARIABLES 
Random Variable 
A Random  Variable X is a real valued function from sample space S to a real number R. 
(or) 
A Random  Variable X is a real number which is determined by the outcomes of the random 
experiment. 
Eg:1.Tosssing 2 coins simultaneously 
               Sample space ={HH,HT,TH,TT} 
Let the random variable be getting number of heads then  
                              X(S)={0,1,2}. 
2.Sum of the two numbers  on throwing 2 dice 
                              X(S)={2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12}. 
 
Types of Random Variables: 
1.Discrete Random Variables : A Random  Variable X is said to be discrete if it takes only the    
   values of the set {0,1,2…..n}. 
Eg:1.Tosssing  a coin, throwing a dice, number of defective items in a bag. 
2. Continuous Random Variables: A Random Variable X which takes all possible values in a   
   given interval of domain. 
Eg: Heights, weights of students in a class. 
 
Discrete Probability Distribution: 
Let x is a Discrete Random Variable with possible outcomes 𝑥ଵ,𝑥ଶ, 𝑥ଷ… . 𝑥௡ having probabilities 
𝑝(𝑥௜)𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑖= 1,2 … 𝑛 .If 𝑝(𝑥௜) > 0 𝑎𝑛𝑑 ∑

 then the function 𝑝(𝑥௜) is called 
Probability mass function of a random variable X and {𝑥௜, 𝑝(𝑥௜)} 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑖= 1,2 … 𝑛 is called 
Discrete Probability Distribution. 
Eg: Tossing  2 coins simultaneously 
       Sample space ={HH,HT,TH,TT} 
Let the random variable be getting number of heads then  
                          X(S) = {0,1,2}.

Properties of Cumulative Distribution function: 
1. 𝑃[𝑎< 𝑥< 𝑏] =  𝐹(𝑏) −𝐹(𝑎) −𝑃[𝑋= 𝑏] 
2. 𝑃[𝑎≤𝑥≤𝑏] =  𝐹(𝑏) −𝐹(𝑎) −𝑃[𝑋= 𝑎] 
3. 𝑃[𝑎< 𝑥≤𝑏] =  𝐹(𝑏) −𝐹(𝑎) 
4. 𝑃[𝑎≤𝑥< 𝑏] =  𝐹(𝑏) −𝐹(𝑎) −𝑃[𝑋= 𝑏] + 𝑃[𝑋= 𝑎]
