SMALL SAMPLES 
 
Introduction When the sample size n < 30, then if is referred to as small samples. In this sampling 
distribution in many cases may not be normal ie., we will not be justified in estimating the 
population parameters as equal to the corresponding sample values. 
Degree Of Freedom The number of independent variates which make up the statistic is known 
as the degrees of freedom (d.f) and it is denoted by 𝜗. 
Example: If 𝑥ଵ+ 𝑥ଶ+ 𝑥ଷ= 50 and we assign any values to two os the variables (say x1, x2 ), 
then the values of x3 will be known. Thus, the two variables are free and independent choices for 
finding the third. 
 
In general, the number of degrees of freedom is equal to the total number of observations 
less the number of independent constraints imposed on the observations. 
For example:in a set of data of n observations, if K is the number of independent constraints then 
𝜗= 𝑛−𝑘 
Student’s t-Distribution Or t-Distribution 
Let 𝑋ത be the mean of a random sample of size n, taken from a normal population having the mean 
𝜇 and the variance 𝜎ଶ, and sample variance 𝑆ଶ=∑

 is a random variable having the 𝑡− distribution with 𝜗= 𝑛−1 degrees of freedom. 
Properties of 𝒕− Distribution 
1. The shape of 𝑡−distribution is bell shaped, which is similar to that of normal distribution and 
is symmetrical about the mean. 
2. The mean of the standard normal distribution as well as 𝑡−distribution is zero, but the 
variance of 𝑡−distrubution depends upon the parometer 𝜗 which is called the degrees of 
freedom. 
3. The variance of 𝑡−distribution exceeds 1, but approaches 1 as 𝑛→∞.
