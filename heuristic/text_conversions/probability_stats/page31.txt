Taking 𝜆ଶ= 𝑘, 𝑤𝑒 𝑔𝑒𝑡 𝑘ଶ−2𝑘−4 = 0 
∴𝑘= 4, −2 
∴λଶ= 4   
λ = 2 
Therefore, Mean of the Poisson distribution = 2 
𝑃(𝑋≤2) = 𝑃(𝑋= 0) + 𝑃(𝑋= 1) + 𝑃(𝑋= 2)

3.A car hire firm has 2 cars which it hires out day by day.The number of demands for a  
car on each day is distributed as poisson with mean 1.5 Calculate the proportion of days 
i)on which there is no demand 
ii) on which demand is refused. 
Sol: Let number of demands for cars be the success. 
Given mean = 1.5= 𝜆 
Using Poisson distribution𝑃(𝑥= 𝑟) =

4.A hospital switch board receives an average of 4 emergency calls in a 10-minute interval.     
   What is the probability that (i) there are at most 2 emergency calls in a 10 minute 
    interval(ii) there are exactly 3emergency calls in a 10-minute interval. 
Sol: Mean, λ= (4 calls/10 minutes) = 4 calls

Sol: Given n= 5,∑𝑓= 142 + 156 + 69 + 27 + 5 + 1 = 400 
∑𝑥௜𝑓௜ == 0(142) + 1(156) + 2(69) + 3(27) + 4(5) + 5(1) = 400 
         ∴ Mean of the distribution =

We have Mean of the Poisson distribution = 𝜆= 1
