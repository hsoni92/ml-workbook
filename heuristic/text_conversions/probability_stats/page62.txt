Step 5 : Making decision:  
By comparing the computed value and the critical value decision is taken for accepting or rejecting 
𝐻଴ 
If calculated value ≤ critical value , we accept 𝐻଴,  
otherwise reject 𝐻଴. 
 
Errors of Sampling : 
While drawing conclusions for population parameters on the basis of the sample results , we have 
two types of errors. 
 Type I error : Reject 𝐻଴ when it is true i.e, if the null hypothesis 𝐻଴ is true but it is rejected 
by test procedure . 
 Type II error : Accept 𝐻଴ when it is false i.e, if the null hypothesis 𝐻଴is false but it is 
accepted by test procedure.

Problems:  
1.If the population is 3,6,9,15,27 
a) List all possible samples of size 3 that can be taken without replacement from 
finite population  
b) Calculate the mean of each of the sampling distribution of means 
c) Find the standard deviation of sampling distribution of means
