TUTORIAL QUESTIONS 
 
1) If the population is 3,6,9,15,27 
a) List all possible samples of size 3 that can be taken without replacement from finite    
population  
b) Calculate the mean of each of the sampling distribution of means 
c) Find the standard deviation of sampling distribution of means 
2) A population consist of five numbers 2,3,6,8 and 11. Consider all possible samples of size 
two which can be drawn with replacement from this population .Find 
a) The mean of the population  
b) The standard deviation of the population  
c) The mean of the sampling distribution of means and  
d) The standard deviation of the sampling distribution of means  
3) A random sample of size 100 is taken from a population with 𝜎 = 5.1 . Given that the sample 
mean is 𝑥̅ = 21.6 Construct a 95% confidence limits for the population mean  . 
4) A normal population has a mean of 0.1 and standard deviation of 2.1 . Find the probability 
that mean of a sample of size 900 will be negative . 
5) A random sample of size 64 is taken from a normal population with 𝜇= 51.4  and 𝜎=  
6.8.What is the probability that the mean of the sample will  
a) exceed 52.9   
b) fall between 50.5 and 52.3   
c) be less than 50.6. 
6) A random sample of 500 apples was taken from a large consignment and 60 were found to 
be bad. Obtain 95% confidence interval for the percentage number of bad apples in the 
consignment. 
7) The average income of 100 people of a city is Rs 210 with a standard deviation of Rs 10.For 
another sample of 150 people the average income is Rs 220 with a standard deviation of 
Rs12.Test the significant difference between two mean at 5% LOS. 
8) A coin is tossed 960 times .Head turned up 184 times. Find whether the coin is unbiased. 
9) Random samples of 600 men and 900 women in a locality were asked they would like to 
have  a bus stop near their residence .350 men and 475 women were in favor of the proposal. 
Test the significance between the difference of two proportions at 5%LOS.
