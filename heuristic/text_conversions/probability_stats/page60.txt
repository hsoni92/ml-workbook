Confidence limits  for population proportion P 
 95% confidence limits are  p ± 1.96(S.E.of  p) 
 99% confidence limits are  p ± 2.58(S.E. of  p)

Testing of Hypothesis :It is an assumption or supposition and the decision making procedure 
about the assumption whether to accept or reject is called hypothesis testing . 
Statistical Hypothesis: To arrive at decision about the population on the basis of sample 
information we make assumptions about the population parameters involved such assumption  
is called a statistical hypothesis . 
 
PROCEDURE FOR TESTING A HYPOTHESIS: 
Test of Hypothesis involves the following steps: 
Step1: Statement of hypothesis : 
There are two types of hypothesis : 
 Null hypothesis: A definite statement about the population parameter. Usually a null 
hypothesis is written as  no difference , denoted by 𝐻଴. 
Ex.  𝐻଴: 𝜇= 𝜇଴ 
 Alternative hypothesis: A statement which contradicts the null hypothesis is called 
alternative hypothesis. Usually an alternative hypothesis is written as some difference , 
denoted by 𝐻ଵ.  
Setting of alternative hypothesis is very important to decide whether it is two-tailed or one 
– tailed alternative , which depends upon the question it is dealing. 
Ex.𝐻ଵ: 𝜇≠𝜇଴ (Two – Tailed test)  
 or  
𝐻ଵ: 𝜇> 𝜇଴ (Right one tailed test)
