Null Hypothesis 𝐻଴ : The sample is drawn from population with mean 𝜇 
ii) 
i.e., 𝐻଴ : 𝜇  =  30.5 years  
iii) 
Alternative Hypothesis 𝐻ଵ : 𝜇< 30.5 ( Left one –tailed test )

vi) 
Conclusion: Since |𝑍௖௔௟| 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 >𝑍ఈvalue , we reject  𝐻଴  
i.e., the sample is not drawn from the population with 𝜇  = 30.5 years. 
 
5. An ambulance service claims that it takes on the average less than 10 minutes to reach 
its destination in emergency calls . A sample of 36 calls has a mean of 11 minutes and 
the variance of 16 minutes .Test the claim at 0.05 los? 
Sol : Given n = 36 , 𝑥̅ =11 , 𝜇  = 10 and 𝜎 = √16 = 4  
i) 
Null Hypothesis 𝐻଴ : 𝜇  =  10  
ii) 
Alternative Hypothesis 𝐻ଵ : 𝜇< 10 ( Left one –tailed test )

6. The means of two large samples of sizes 1000 and 2000 members are 67.5 inches and 
68 inches respectively . Can the samples be regarded as drawn from the same 
population of S.D 2.5 inches. 
Sol: Let 𝜇ଵ and 𝜇ଶ be the means of the two populations  
Given 𝑛ଵ = 1000 ,𝑛ଶ = 2000 and 𝑥̅ଵ = 67.5 inches , 𝑥̅ଶ = 68 inches  
Population S.D, 𝜎 = 2.5 inches 
i) 
Null Hypothesis 𝐻଴ :The samples have been drawn from the same population of S.D 
2.5 inches 
i.e., 𝐻଴ : 𝜇ଵ = 𝜇ଶ 
ii) 
Alternative Hypothesis 𝐻ଵ :𝜇ଵ≠𝜇ଶ( Two – Tailed test)

v) 
Conclusion: Since |𝑍௖௔௟| 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 >𝑍ఈvalue , we reject  𝐻଴  
Hence , we conclude that the samples are not drawn from the same population of S.D 
2.5 inches. 
 
7. Samples of students were drawn from two universities and from their weights in 
kilograms , mean and standard deviations are calculated and shown below. Make a 
large sample test to test the significance of the difference between the means.
