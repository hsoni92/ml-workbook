Since calculated F < tabulated F, we accept the null hypothesis 𝐻଴ at 5% los  i.e., there is no 
significant difference between the variances of the distribution by the workers. 
 
 
3. A sample of 26 machinery parts gives a mean working hours of 990 hrs with a S.D of  
20 hrs. The manufacturer claims that the mean working hrs of the parts is 1000 hrs. Is 
the sample not up to the standard?  
 
Sol:Here the sample size = 26<30, ∴ it is small sample.  
Given sample mean  𝑥 
തതത= 990 
Population mean,  𝜇   = 1000  
S.D.        = 20 
Degrees of freedom = n-1 = 26-1 = 25 
We use students t test. 
1. Null hypothesis  H0 : The sample is up to the standard. 
2. Alternate hypothesis H1 :𝜇 < 1000 ( left tail test) 
3. Level of significance   :∝ = 0.05 
4. The test statistic is t =

             ⸫|𝑡 |= 2.5  
 
Tabulated value of t at 5% los with 25 degrees of freedom for left tailed test is 1.708. 
Since the calculated t > the tabulated t, we reject the null hypothesis H0 and conclude that the  
sample is not up to the mark.

Test whether two horses have the same running capacity at 5% values of t for 11 dof. 
 
Sol: Here n1 = 7 and n2 = 6 
Sample mean and S.D is not given in the question. First calculate mean and S.D
