ASSIGNMENT QUESTIONS 
1. A sales tax officer has reported that the average sales of the 500  business that he has to       
     deal with during a year is Rs.36,000 with a standard deviation of Rs.10,000. Assuming   
    that  the sales in these business are normally distributed ,find : 
 
  i) The number of business as the sales of which are greater than Rs.40,000 
  ii) The percentage of business the sales of which are likely to range between Rs.30,000 and        
       Rs.40,000 
 
 2. If the variance of a Poisson  variate is 3 . Find the probability that                              
         i) P(x=0)           ii)P(1≤x≤4)              iii) P(x>2) 
 
3. The mean and SD of a normal variate are 8 and 4 respectively .Find  i) P( 5≤x≤10)       
    ii)P(x≥5) 
 
4. Average number of accidents on any day on a national highway is 1.8 .determine the  
    probability that the number of accidents are  i) atleast one  ii) at the most one  iii) exactly
