Continuous Probability distribution: 
Let X be a continuous random variable taking values on the interval (a,b). A function f(x) is  
said to be the Probability density function of x if 
i) 
f(x) > 0 ∀ x ∈(a, b) 
ii) 
Total area under the probability curve is 1i. e, ∫f(x)dx = 1.

iii) 
For two distinct numbers ‘c’ and ‘d’ in (𝑎, 𝑏) is given by P(c < 𝑥< 𝑑) =
Area under the probability curve between ordinates x = c and x = d i. e 
∫f(x)dx.

Note: P(c < 𝑥< 𝑑) = P(c ≤x ≤d) = P(c ≤x < 𝑑) = P(c < 𝑥≤𝑑)

Mean: The meanof the continuous Probability Distribution is defined as 
μ = න

Expectation:The Expectationof the continuous Probability Distribution is defined as 
E(X) =∫

In general,E(g(x)) = ∫

Properties: 
1)E(X) =  μ 
2)E(X) =  k E(X) 
3) E(X + k) =  E(X) +  k 
4) ) E(aX ± b) =  aE(X) ±  b 
 
Variance: The variance of the Continuous Probability Distribution is defined as  
 Var(X) =  V(X) = න
xଶ f(x)dx −μଶ.

Properties: 
1)V(c) = 0 where c is a constant 
2) V(kX) = kଶ V(X) 
3) V(X + k) =  V(X) 
4) V(aX ± b) = aଶ V(X) 
 
Mean Deviation: Mean deviation of continuous probability distribution function is defined  
                        as    M.D =∫
|x −μ| f(x)dx.

Median: Median is the point which divides the entire distribution in to two equal parts. In case  
of continuous distribution, median is the point which divides the total area in to two  
equal parts i.e.,∫

Mode: Mode is the value of x for which f(x)is maximum. 
i.ef ᇱ(x) = 0 and f "(x) < 0  for x ∈(a, b)
