From the given condition , the area of the probability normal curve to the left of √௡
ସ  
should be 0.95 
∴ The area between 0 and √୬
ସ  is 0.45 
We do not want to know about the bulbs which have life above the guranteed life . 
∴√௡
ସ=  1.65  i.e., √𝑛   = 6.6  
∴ n = 44 
11.A normal population has a mean of 0.1 and standard deviation of 2.1 . Find the  
probability that mean of a sample of size 900 will be negative . 
Sol : Given 𝜇= 0.1  , 𝜎= 2.1 and  n = 900

∴𝑥̅  = 0.1  +  0.007 z    where z  ~ N ( 0 ,1)  
∴  The required  probability , that the sample mean is negative is given by  
𝑃( 𝑥 ഥ< 0 ) = P ( 0.1 + 0.07 z < 0)  
                   = P ( 0.07 z < - 0.1 )

                   = P  ( z < -1.43 ) 
 
                   = 0.50 – P ( 0<  z  < 1.43 ) 
                   = 0.50 – 0.4236 = 0.0764  
12.In a study of an automobile insurance a random sample of 80 body repair costs had a  
mean of  Rs 472.36 and the S.D of  Rs 62.35. If 𝒙ഥഥ is used as a point estimator to the true  
average repair costs , with what confidence we can assert that the maximum error doesn’t  
exceed Rs 10. 
Sol : Size of a random sample , n = 80 
The mean of random sample ,𝑥̅  = Rs 472.36 
Standard deviation ,𝜎  = Rs 62.35 
Maximum error of estimate ,𝐸 ௠௔௫  = Rs 10 
We have 𝐸 ௠௔௫ =𝑍ఈଶ

 ∴𝑍ఈଶ

The area when z = 1.43 from tables is 0.4236 
∴ 
ఈ
ଶ  = 0.4236   i.e ., 𝛼 = 0.8472 
∴ confidence = (1- 𝛼 ) 100% = 84.72 %  
Hence we are 84.72% confidence that the maximum error is Rs. 10 
13.If we can assert with 95% that the maximum error is 0.05 and P = 0.2 find the size of the  
sample. 
Sol : Given P =0.2 , E = 0.05 
We have Q = 0.8 and 𝑍ఈଶ
ൗ= 1.96 ( 5% LOS )
