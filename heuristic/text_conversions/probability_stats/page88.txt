Hence we conclude that the sample cannot be regarded as taken from population. 
b) The 95% confidence limits of the mean of the population are given by

√௡ = 53 ± 2.13 × 0.79 
                    = 53 ± 1.6827  
                     = 54.68 and 51.31 
∴ 95% confidence limits are( 51.31, 54.68 ) 
 
3. A random sample of 10 boys had the following I.Q’s : 70, 120 ,110, 101,88, 83,95,98,107 
and 100. 
a) Do these data support the assumption of a population mean I.Q of 100? 
b) Find a reasonable range in which most of the mean I.Q values of samples of 10 
boys lie 
Sol: Since mean and s.d  are not given  
We have to determine these
