 The student acquires solid skills of implementing and applying the computational methods 
learnt. 
The idea is that making the student comfortable with both advanced mathematical concepts and 
modern computational techniques, will open a wealth of possibilities of applying mathematics to 
problems of real interest.  
  
Probability and Statistics: Course Description 
         
    This course is about the mathematics that is most widely used in the engineering core subjects. 
Probability and Statistics provide an introduction to discrete and continuous probability 
distributions, correlation and regression analysis, sampling distributions and sampling 
inferences.Topics include the properties of both single and multiple random variables for the 
discrete and continuous probability distributions, correlation and regression analysis for bivariate 
as well as multivariate distributions, Estimation, sampling, testing of hypothesis for both large and 
small samples.
