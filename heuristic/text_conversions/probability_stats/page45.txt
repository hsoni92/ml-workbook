Properties 
1. The value ofρlies between+1 and −1. 
2. Ifρ = 1, then there is complete agreement in the order of the ranks & the direction of the rank 
is same. 
3. Ifρ = −1, then there is complete disagreement in the order of the ranks & they are in opposite  
directions. 
Equal or Repeated ranks 
If any 2 or more items are with same value the in that case common ranks are given to repeated 
items. The common rank is the average of the ranks which these items would have assumed, if 
they were different from each other and the next item will get the rank next to ranks already 
assumed. 
Formula:ρ = 1 −6{

where m =the  number of items whose ranks are common. 
N-Number of paired observations. 
Dଶ- Sum of the squares of the differences of two ranks 
REGRESSION 
In regression we can estimate value of one variable with the value of the other variable which is 
known. The statistical method which helps us to estimate the unknown value of one variable from 
the known value of the related variable is called ‘Regression’. The line described in the average 
relationship b/w 2 variables is known as Line of Regression. 
 
Regression Equation:  
The standard form of the Regression equation is Y =  a +  bX where a, b are called constants. ‘a’ 
indicates value of Y when X = 0. It is called Y-intercept. ‘b’ indicates the value of slope of the 
regression line & gives a measure of change of y for a unit change in X . it is also called as 
regression coefficient of Y on X. The values of a, b are found with the help of following Normal 
Equations. 
 Normal Equations for Regression Equation of Y onX are   
∑Y= Na + b∑X 
∑XY= a ∑X+ b∑Xଶ 
Normal Equations for Regression Equation of X on Yare
