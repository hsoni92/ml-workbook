   = -1.365 and d.f = n-1 = 9 
 Tabulated value of t for 9 d.f at 5% los is 1.833 
Conclusion: Since |t ୡୟ୪| value <|t஑|value , we accept  𝐻଴  
Hence we conclude that there is no significant difference in memory capacity after the training 
program. 
 
 
Chi-Square (𝝌𝟐) Distribution 
Chi square distribution is a type of cumulative probability distribution . probability distributions 
provide the probability of every possible value that may occur . Distributions that are cumulative 
give the probability of a random variable being less than or equal to a particular value. Since the 
sum of the probabilities of every possible value must equal one , the total area under the curve is 
equal to one . Chi square distributions vary depending on the degrees of freedom. The degrees of 
freedom is found by subtracting one from the number of categories in the data .
