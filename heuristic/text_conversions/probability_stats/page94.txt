Applications of Chi – Square Distribution: 
Chi – Square test as a test of goodness of fit : 
 
𝝌𝟐– test enables us to ascertain how well the theoretical distributions such as binomial, 
Poisson, normal etc, fit the distributions obtained from sample data. If the calculated value of 𝝌𝟐is 
less than the table value at a specified level of generally 5% significance, the fit is considered to 
be good. 
If the calculated value of 𝝌𝟐is greater than the table value, the fit is considered to be poor. 
i) Null hypothesis: H଴: There is no difference in given values and calculated values  
ii)Altenative hypothesis: Hଵ: There is some difference in given values and calculated values 
iii) Test Statistic 𝛘𝟐

iv)At specified level of significance for n-1 d.f if the given problem is binomial distribution  
At specified level of significance for n-2 d.f if the given problem is Poisson distribution  
v)Conclusion :If𝝌𝟐

2. Chi – Square test for independence of attributes : 
Definition : An attribute means a quality or characteristic 
Eg: Drinking, Smoking, blindness, Honesty, beauty etc., 
 
An attribute may be marked by its presence or absence in a number of a given population. 
Let us consider two attributes A and B. 
A is divided into two classes and B is divided into two classes. The various cell frequencies can 
be expressed in the following table known as 2x2 contingency table. 
a
b
a + b
c
d
c+ d
a + c
b + d
N =a + b + c + d
The expected frequencies are given by 
𝐸(𝑎) = (𝑎+ 𝑐)(𝑎+ 𝑏)
𝑁
 
𝐸(𝑏) = (𝑏+ 𝑐)(𝑎+ 𝑏)
𝑁
 
𝐸(𝑐) = (𝑎+ 𝑐)(𝑐+ 𝑑)
