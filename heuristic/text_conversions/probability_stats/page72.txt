v) 
Conclusion: Since |𝑍௖௔௟| 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 >𝑍ఈvalue , we reject  𝐻଴  
∴ Sample cannot be regarded as one coming from the population 
2. In a random sample of 60 workers , the average time taken by them to get to work is 
33.8 minutes with a standard deviation of 6.1 minutes . Can we reject the null 
hypothesis 𝝁 = 32.6 in favor of alternative null hypothesis 𝝁> 32.6 at 𝜶 = 0.05 LOS 
Sol : Given n = 60 , 𝑥̅ = 33.8 , 𝜇 = 32.6 and 𝜎 = 6.1 
i) 
Null Hypothesis 𝐻଴ : 𝜇 = 32.6 
ii) 
Alternative Hypothesis 𝐻ଵ : 𝜇> 32.6 ( Right one tailed test )

3. A sample of 400 items is taken from a population whose standard deviation is 10 . 
The mean of the sample is 40 . Test whether the sample has come from  a population 
with mean 38 . Also calculate 95% confidence limits for the population . 
Sol : Given n = 400 , 𝑥̅ = 40 , 𝜇 = 38 and 𝜎 = 10 
i) 
Null Hypothesis 𝐻଴ : 𝜇 = 38 
ii) 
Alternative Hypothesis 𝐻ଵ : 𝜇≠38 ( Two –tailed test )

v) 
Conclusion: Since |𝑍௖௔௟| 𝑣_𝑙𝑢𝑒 >𝑍ఈvalue , we reject  𝐻଴  
i.e., the sample is not from the population whose is 38. 
∴  95% confidence interval is ቀ𝑥̅ −1.96.

4. An insurance agent has claimed that the average age of policy holders who issue 
through him is less than the average for all agents which is 30.5. A random sample of 
100 policy holders who had issued through him gave the following age distribution . 
Age 
16-20 
21-25 
26-30 
31-35

Calculate the arithmetic mean and standard deviation of this distribution and use 
these     values to test his claim at 5% los.
