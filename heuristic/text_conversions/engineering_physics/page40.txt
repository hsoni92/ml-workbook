Classification of solids into conductors , Semiconductors & Insulators: 
Based on the energy band diagram materials or solids are classified as follows: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Conductors:In this kind of materials, there is no forbidden gap between the valence band and 
conduction band. It is observed that the valence band overlaps with the conduction band in 
metals as shown in figure. There are sufficient numbers of free electrons, available for 
electrical conduction and due to the overlapping of the two bands there is an easy transition of 
electrons from one band to another band takes place, and there no chance for the presence of 
holes. Resistivity of conductors is very small and it is very few milli ohm meters.(Ω m ). 
Examples: All metals (Na, Mg, Al, Cu, Ni Cu, Ag, Li, Ar etc)  
Semiconductors: 
 In semiconductors, there is a band gap exists between the valence band and conduction band 
and it is very less and it is the order of -1 to 2 eV are known as semiconductors.It will conduct 
electricity partially at normal conditions. The electrical resistivity values are 0.5 to 103 ohm 
meter. Due to thermal vibrations within the solid, some electrons gain enough energy to 
overcome the band gap (or barrier) and behave as conduction electrons. Conductivity exists 
here due to electronics and holes.  
Examples: Silicon, Germanium, Ga As. 
Insulators: 
 In insulators, the width of forbidden energy gap between the valence band and conduction 
band is very large. Due to large energy gap, electrons cannot jump from V.B to C.B.Energy 
gap is of the order of ~10 eV and higher than semiconductors. Resistivity values of insulators 
are 107 to 1012 ohm-m. Electrons are tightly bound to the nucleus, no valence electrons are 
available.  
Examples: Wood, rubber,glass.
