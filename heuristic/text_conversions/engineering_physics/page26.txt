R maximum means –ve values must vanish and all 𝛼 terms on right hand side should be equal 
to zero.it is possible 
 if sin𝜃=0                                             [where 𝛼=
𝜋𝑒 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃
𝜆
] 
𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑛 𝜃= 0                                     … . .  𝑖s the condition for principal maximumwith high 
intensity. 
R=A               𝐼𝑚𝑎𝑥= 𝑅2 = 𝐴2 
Condition for minimum intensity: 
I will be minimum when sin𝛼= 0 
𝛼= ±𝜋, ±2𝜋, ±3𝜋, … .. 
𝛼= ±𝑚𝜋 
𝜋𝑒 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃
𝜆
= ±𝑚𝜋  
                                                                     𝑒 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃= ±𝑚𝜆                             𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝑚= 1,2,3, ….  
Thus ,we obtain the points of minimum intensity on either side of principal maximum. 
Diffraction grating: 
Diffraction grating is closed placed multiple slits. It 
consists of very large number of narrow slits side by side 
separated by opaque spaces. The incident light is transmitted 
through the slits and blocked by opaque spaces. Such a 
grating is called transmission grating. 
 
When light passes through the grating, each one of 
the slit diffracts the waves. All the diffracted waves combine 
one another producing sharp and intense maxima on the screen. 
A plane transmission grating is a plane sheet of transparent material on which opaque 
lines are made with a diamond point. The space between the rulings is equal and transparent 
and consists of parallel slits. The combined width of a ruling and a slit is called grating 
element.  
Let ‘e’ be the width of the line and‘d’ be the width of the slit. Then (e + d) is known as 
grating element. If ‘N’ is the no. of lines per inch on the grating then
