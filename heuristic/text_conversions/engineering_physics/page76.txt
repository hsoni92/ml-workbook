 Consider a cross-sectional view of an optical fiber having core & cladding of refractive 
indices n1 and n2. 
 Let the fiber be in air medium (no). The incident light while entering into the core at ‘A’ 
makes an incident angle of ‘αi’ with the fiber-axis. 
 In core it travels along AB & is incident at part B on cladding interface. 
 Let αr be the angle of refraction at part ‘A’ & ‘θ’ be the angle of incidence at ‘B’. 
 When ‘θ’ is greater than the critical angle ‘θc’, then total internal reflection takes place 
into the core & light takes the path BD. 
 Due to multiple total internal reflections the propagation of light ray takes place 
through the fiber. 
 Applying  Snell’s law at AC core-air interface :-

𝑠𝑖𝑛α𝑟=

𝑛𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑛α𝑖= 𝑛1𝑠𝑖𝑛α𝑟           →(1) 
 Let a normal ‘BC’ be drawn from the point ‘B’ to the fiber axis. Then from ∆ABC, we 
get 
α𝑟= 90° − 𝜃→(2) 
Substitute eq - (2) in eq - (1) 
 𝑛𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑛α𝑖= 𝑛1𝑠𝑖𝑛 (90° −𝜃) 
𝑛𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑛α𝑖= 𝑛1𝑐𝑜𝑠𝜃→(3) 
 To get total internal reflection at 
point B  
                (Core-Classing Interface) i.e. 
 
 Let the maximum angle of incidence at point A be α𝑖(max)for which
. 
From eqn (3), we get 
𝑛𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑛α𝑖= 𝑛1𝑐𝑜𝑠𝜃→(4) 
 α𝑖(max) = α𝑖,when 𝜃= 𝜃𝑐 
𝑠𝑖𝑛 α𝑖(max) = 
𝑛1
𝑛𝑜𝑐𝑜𝑠𝜃𝑐→(5) 
We know that     𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃𝑐=
