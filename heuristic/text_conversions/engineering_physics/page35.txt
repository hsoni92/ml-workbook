The solution of these equations from Bloch theorem,     𝜓𝑘(𝑥) = 𝑢𝑘(𝑥)𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝑖𝑘𝑥) .               
From figure, square well potentials, if 𝑉0 increases, the width of barrier ‘w’ decreases, if 𝑉0 
decreases the width of barrier w increases. But the (product) barrier strength 𝑉0𝑤 remains 
constant. 
To get this, differentiating above Schrodinger wave equations 3 & 4 w.r.to x, and by applying 
boundary conditions of x (w.r.to their correspondingΨ), to known the values of constants  
A, B of region -I, C,D-for reg-II,we get mathematical expression (by simplification)

And ‘𝑣₀ b’ is known as barrier strength.
