Optical fibers can be classified based on either the mode they support or the refractive index 
profile of the fiber. They can also be classified based on the material of the fiber. 
Based on Mode: 
The rays travelling in the fiber by total internal reflection are called modes. 
1) Single mode fibers: 
 If the thickness of the fiber is so small that it supports only one mode then the fiber is 
called single modefiberor mono mode fiber. 
 The core diameter of this fiber is about 8 to 10µm and the outer diameter of cladding is 
60 to 70µm. 
 
 
 
2)Multi mode fibers: 
 If the thickness of the fiber is very large that it supports more than one mode then the 
fiber is called multi mode fiber. 
 The core diameter of this fiber is about 50 to 200µm and the outer diameter of cladding 
is 100 to 250µm. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Based on refractive index profile: 
1) Step-Index Optical fiber: 
 In a step-index optical fiber, the entire core has 
uniform refractive index n1 slightly greater than 
the refractive index of the cladding n2.  
 Since the index profile is in the form of a step, 
these fibers are called step-index fibers.  
 The transmission of information will be in the 
form of signals or pulses. 
 These are extensively used because distortion and transmission losses are very less. 
 Step-index optical fibers are of two types.
