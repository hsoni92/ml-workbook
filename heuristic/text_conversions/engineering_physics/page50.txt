B = µ0(H + I) 
It is the relation in SI unit 
 
Magnetic Susceptibility(𝝌):The ratio of magnetization to the magnetic intensity.

It has no units when a material has high susceptibility then it can be easily magnetized. 
 
Relation between Permeability and Susceptibility: 
 
 
 
 
We know that       B∝ (H+I) 
B = µo (H+I)       
In vacuumB= µo H  + µo I

Origin of magnetic moment:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Materials are made up of atoms. These atoms consist of positively charged 
nucleus, surrounded by cloud of electrons. In all atoms electrons are revolving around the 
nucleus in different orbits and also spin about their own axis. These revolving electrons 
constitute an electrical current in the orbits. These revolving electrons produces its own orbital 
magnetic dipole moment, measured in Bohr magneton(𝜇𝐵) and there is also a spin magnetic 
moment associated with it (spin of orbital electrons and spin of nucleus).In most materials 
there is no resultant magnetic moments, due to the electrons being grouped in pairs causing 
the magnetic moment to be cancelled by its neighbour. Under external applied magnetic field 
these dipoles experience torque in the direction of applied field and the atom acquires certain 
magnetism.  
So, the magnetic moment of an atom is due to    
1.  Orbital magnetic moment of the electrons. 
2.  Spin magnetic moment of the electrons. 
3.  Spin magnetic moment of the nucleus.
