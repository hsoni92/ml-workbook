Let  E1 and  E2 be  the  energies  of  ground  and  excited  states  of  an  atom. Suppose, 
if a photon of energy E2−E1 = hν  interacts with an atom present in the ground state, the atom 
gets excitation form ground state E1 to excited state E2 .  This process is called stimulated 
absorption. 
 
 
 
 
 
Stimulated absorption rate depends upon the number of atoms available in the lowest 
energy state as well as the energy density of photons. 
SPONTANEOUS EMISSION:  
The atom in the excited state returns to ground state emitting a photon of energy (E) = 
E2 – E1 = hv, without applying an external energy spontaneously is known as spontaneous 
emission. 
 Let E1 and E2 be the energies of ground and excited states of an atom. Suppose, if 
photon of energy E2− E1 = hν interacts with an atom present in the ground state, the atom gets 
excitation form ground state E1 to excited state E2 
The excited atom does not stay for a long time in the excited state. The excited atom 
gets de-excitation after its life time by emitting a photon of energy E2− E1 = hν . This process is 
called spontaneous emission. 
The spontaneous emission rate depends up on the number of atoms present in the excited state. 
 The probability of spontaneous emission (P21) is independent of u(𝜗). 
𝑃21 = 𝐴21 
 
 
STIMULATED-EMISSION:   
The atom in the excited state can also returns to the ground state by applying external 
energy or inducement of photon thereby emitting two photons which are having same energy 
as that of incident photon. This process is called as stimulated emission. 
Stimulated emission was postulated by Einstein. Let E1 and E2 be the energies of 
ground and excited states of an atom. Let a Photon of energy E2-E1=hυ interacts with the 
excited atom with in their life time The atom gets de-excitation to ground state by emitting of 
another photon.
