APPLICATIONS OF LASERS 
Due to high intensity, high mono-chromaticity and high directionality of lasers, they are 
widely used in various fields like 
1. communication  
2. computers  
3. chemistry  
4. photography  
5. industry  
6. medicine  
7. military  
8. scientific research  
1.  Communication:  
 In case of optical communication, semiconductors laser diodes are used as optical 
sources.   
 More channels can be sent simultaneously Signal cannot be tapped as the band 
width is large, more data can be sent.  
 A laser is highly directional and less divergence, hence it has greater potential use 
in space crafts and submarines.  
2. Computers : 
 In LAN (local area network), data can be transferred from memory storage of one 
computer to other computer using laser for short time.  
 Lasers are used in CD-ROMS during recording and reading the data.  
3. Chemistry : 
 Lasers are used in molecular structure identification. 
 Lasers are also used to accelerate some chemical reactions.  
 Using lasers, new chemical compound can be created by breaking bonds between 
atoms or molecules.  
4. Photography : 
 Lasers can be used to get 3-D lens lessphotography. 
 Lasers are also used in the construction of holograms.  
 
5. Industry : 
 Lasers can be used to blast holes in diamonds and hard 
steel. 
  Lasers are also used as a source of intense heat. 
 Carbon dioxide laser is used for cutting drilling of metals and nonmetals, such as 
ceramics   plastics, glass etc.  
 High power lasers are used to weld or melt any material.  
 Lasers are also used to cut teeth in saws and test the quality of fabric.
