geometrical shadow consists of bright and dark fringes. These fringes are due to the  
superposition of bended light waves around the corners of an obstacle. The amount of bending 
depends upon the size of an obstacle and wavelength of light. 
When light falls on an obstacle whose size is comparable with the wavelength of light 
then light bends around the edges or corners of an obstacle and enters into the geometrical 
shadow. This bending of light is known as diffraction. 
Types of Diffraction: 
The diffraction phenomena are broadly classified into two types. 
1. Fresnel’s Diffraction:  
In this type of diffraction, the source of light and the screen are placed at finite distance. 
In this, lenses are not necessary to study the diffraction. This diffraction can be studied in the 
direction of propagation of light. The incident wave fronts are either spherical or cylindrical. 
2. Fraunhofer’s Diffraction: 
In this type of diffraction, the source and screen are placed at infinite distances. Here 
we need lenses to study the diffraction. This diffraction can be studied in any direction. In this, 
the incident wavefront is plane.

Fraunhofer’s diffraction at single slit: 
Consider a slit AB of width ‘e’. Let a plane wavefront WW’ of monochromatic light of 
wavelength λ propagating normally towards the slit is incident on it. The diffracted light
