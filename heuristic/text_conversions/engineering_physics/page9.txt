From eq(2) 
𝑥= 𝐶1𝑒+𝑖ωt + 𝐶2𝑒−𝑖ωt 
Where 𝐶1 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝐶2 are arbitrary constants 
𝑥= 𝐶1[cos 𝜔𝑡+ 𝑖 sin 𝜔𝑡] + 𝐶2[cos𝜔𝑡−𝑖 sin 𝜔𝑡] 
𝑥= (𝐶1 + 𝐶2) cos 𝜔𝑡 +  𝑖(𝐶1 −𝐶2) sin 𝜔𝑡 
Let us put 𝐶1 + 𝐶2 = 𝑎sin 𝜙   and   𝐶1 −𝐶2 = 𝑎cos 𝜙 
Where a and ϕ are constants 
𝑥= 𝑎sin 𝜙 cos 𝜔𝑡 +  𝑖𝑎cos 𝜙sin 𝜔𝑡 
𝑥= 𝑎sin(𝜔𝑡+ 𝜙 ) -------- (4) 
Equation (4) is the solution of simple harmonic motion. 
Damped harmonic oscillator: 
 
Definition:Damped harmonic motion is defined as decay or decrease of amplitude of motion 
with respect to time in presence of air or other medium. The oscillator which performs such 
type of motion is known asdamped harmonic oscillator. 
Ex: Motion of tuning fork, Motion of simple pendulum. etc. 
 
Equation for damped harmonic oscillator: 
The damped system is subjected to: 
 
i) A   restoring force which is proportional to displacement but oppositely directed. This is            
   written   as  −𝑘𝑥  where k is force constant. 
ii) Frictional force:Frictional force is proportional to velocity but oppositely directed, given 
by  
f2 α −dx
dt 
f2 = −r (

dt) ------------- (2)          Where ‘r’ is frictional force per unit velocity. 
Since,     𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑐𝑒 =  𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑠 × 𝑎𝑐𝑐𝑙𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛= 𝑚

Therefore, the equation of the motion of particle is given by

Where

Here b is damping constant, and this is a differential equation of damped harmonic motion.
