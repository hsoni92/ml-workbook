Antiferro magnetic materials: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
These are the ferromagnetic materials in which the magnetic 
interaction between any two dipoles aligns themselves anti parallel to 
each other. All the dipoles are equal in magnitude. Therefore the 
resultant magnetization is zero. 
 
 
 
Properties: 
1. Susceptibility is small and positive for these materials. 
2. Spin alignment is systematic, but in anti parallel manner. 
3. Initially, the susceptibility increases slightly as the temperature 
increases, and beyond a particular temperature known as Neel 
temperature the susceptibility decreases with temperature.  
4. The temperature at which anti ferromagnetic material converts into paramagnetic 
material is known as Neel`s temperature. 
5. Susceptibility is inversely proportional to the temperature. The 
variation of susceptibility with temperature is expressed as 
𝜒=
𝐶
𝑇+𝑇𝑁         When T > TN 
𝜒∝𝑇                When T < TN

Transition 
of 
material at Tc 
Do not change. 
On cooling these are 
converted 
into 
ferromagnetic 
material. 
Converted into  
para magnetic material 
aboveTc. 
In the presence 
of 
magnetic 
field. 
The magnetic lines of 
force are pulled out 
from 
the 
material 
.Hence, magnetic flux 
density 
is 
greater, 
outside the material 
than inside. 
 
The magnetic lines of 
force 
are 
attracted 
towards the centre of 
the material and hence 
the Bin material is 
greater than the B out. 
 
 
The magnetic lines of 
force are highly attracted 
towards the centre of the 
material and hence the 
Bin 
material 
is 
very 
greater than the B out.
