SOFT AND HARD MAGNETIC MATERIALS:  
 
 
Ferromagnetic materials are classified into two types based on the characteristic parameters 
such as hystersis and magnetisation. They are  
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Hard magnetic materials   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  2. Soft magnetic materials 
 
S.NO SOFT MAGNETIC MATERIAL 
HARD MAGNETIC MATERIAL 
1 
Materials 
which 
can 
be 
easily 
magnetized and demagnetized are 
called Soft magnetic materials. 
Materials 
which 
can’t 
be 
easily 
magnetized and demagnetized are 
called hard magnetic materials.  
2 
The nature of hysteresis loop is very 
steep 
The nature of hysteresis loop is very  
large. 
 
3 
They are prepared by annealing 
process. 
They are prepared by quenching 
process. 
4 
Due to small hysteresis loop area, 
they have small hysteresis loss. 
Due to large hysteresis loop area, they 
have large hysteresis loss. 
5 
They 
have 
large 
value 
of 
permeability and susceptibility. 
They have low value of permeability 
and susceptibility. 
6 
The coercivity and retentivity are 
small. 
The coercivity and retentivity are 
large. 
7 
They are free from irregularities. 
They have large amount of impurities 
and lattice defects. 
8 
They are used  
 To produce temporary magnets. 
 In the preparation of magnetic 
core 
materials 
used 
in 
transformers, electric motors , 
magnetic amplifiers, 
magnetic 
switching circuits, etc., 
They are used  
 To produce permanent magnets. 
 In 
loud 
speakers, 
toys, 
in 
measuring meters, microphones, 
magnetic 
detectors, 
magnetic 
separators, etc.,
