INTRODUCTION: 
LASER stands for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation. Laser technology 
started with Albert Einstein in 1917, he has given theoretical basis for the development of 
Laser. The technology further evolved in 1960 when the very first laser called Ruby Laser was 
built at Hughes Research Laboratoriesby T.H. Mainmann. 
CHARACTERISTIC OF LASER RADIATION: 
The laser beam has the properties given below which distinguish it from an ordinary beam of 
light. Those are 
1. Highly directional  
2. Highly monochromatic  
3. Highly intense  
4. Highly coherence  
1. Highly directional: 
A conventional light source emits light in all directions. On the other hand, Laser emits 
light only in one direction. The width of Laser beam is extremely narrow and hence a laser 
beam can travel to long distances without spreading. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The directionality of laser beam is expressedin terms of divergence 
∆𝜃= 𝑟2 −𝑟1
𝑑2 −𝑑1
 
Where r1and r2are the radii of laser beam spots at distances of d1 and d2 respectively from laser 
source. 
 
2.  Highly monochromatic: 
A monochromatic source is a single frequency or single wavelength source of light. 
The laser light is more monochromatic than that of a convectional light source. This may be 
due to the stimulated characteristic of laser light. The band width of convectional 
monochromatic light source is 1000A0. But the band width of ordinary light source is 10 A0. 
For high sensitive laser source is 10-8 A0.  
 
3.  Highly intense: 
Laser light is highly intense than the conventional light. A one milli-Watt He-Ne laser is 
highly intense than the sun intensity. This is because of coherence and directionality of laser.
