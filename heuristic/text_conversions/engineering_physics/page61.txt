EINSTEIN COEFFICIENTS & THEIR RELATIONS 
Einstein coefficients: 
Einstein mathematically expressed the statistical nature of the three possible radiative 
transition routes (spontaneous emission, stimulated emission, and absorption) with the so-
called Einstein coefficients and quantified the relations between the three processes. 
Let N1 be the number of atoms per unit volume with energy E1 and N2 be the number of 
atoms per unit volume with energy E2. Let ‘n’ be the number of photons per unit volume at 
frequency ‘υ’ such that E2– E1= ℎ𝜗 Then, the energy density of photons E= ℎ𝜗 . 
 Stimulated absoption: When the photons interact with the atoms it leads to absorption 
transition which is called as stimulated absorption. Stimulated absorption rate depends 
upon the number of atoms available in the lowest energy state as well as the energy 
density photons. 
                                    Stimulated absorption rate ∝N1 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                      = B12 N1
 
            Where B12 is the Einstein coefficient of stimulated absorption. 
 Spontaneous emission: The atom in the excited state returns to ground state emitting a 
photon of energy (E) = E2 – E1 =hν, without applying an external energy spontaneously 
is known as spontaneous emission.The spontaneous emission rate depends up on the 
number of atoms present in the excited state. 
Spontaneous emission rate   N 2 
   = A21 N 2 
Where A21 is the Einstein coefficient of spontaneous emission. 
 Stimulated emission: The atom in the excited state can also returns to the ground state 
by applying external energy or inducement of photon thereby emitting two photons 
which are having same energy as that of incident photon. This process is called as 
stimulated emission. Stimulated emission rate depends upon the number of atoms 
available in the excited state as well as the energy density of  incident photons. 
                             Stimulated emission rate  N 2 
 
                                                               =  B21 N 2
 
          Where B21 is the Einstein coefficient of stimulated emission. 
 
If the system is in equilibrium, the rates of absorption transitions (Stimulated 
absorption) are equal to emission transitions(The rate of Spontaneous + Stimulated emission). 
The rate of Absorption = The rate of Spontaneous + Stimulated emission
