Explanation: 
Let us consider a denser medium & rarer medium of refractive indices n1& n2 respectively and 
n1>n2. Let a light ray move from denser to rare medium with ‘i’ as the angle of incidence & ‘r’ 
as angle of refraction. The refracted ray bends away from the normal as it travels from denser 
to rarer medium with increase of angle of incidence ‘i’.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In this we get three cases 
Case-1: When i<θc, Then the light ray refracts into rarer medium as shown in figure. 
 
Case-2: When i= θc , then the light ray traverses along the two media as shown in figure. 
       For the two media, applying Snell’s law 
𝑛1𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑖= 𝑛2𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑟 
(∴  𝑖= 𝜃𝑐& 𝑟= 90°) 
𝑛1𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃𝑐= 𝑛2𝑠𝑖𝑛90 
𝑛1𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃𝑐= 𝑛2 
𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃𝑐= 𝑛2
𝑛1
 
Where n1>n2 
For air, n2 =1,  
𝜃𝑐= 𝑠𝑖𝑛−1 1
𝑛1
 
Case-3:When i> θc, then the light ray reflected back into the medium as shown in figure 
 
ACCEPTANCE ANGLE & ACCEPTANCE CONE: 
Def: Acceptance angle is the maximum angle of incidence at the core of an optical fiber so that 
the light can be guided though the fiber by total internal reflection. This angle is called as 
acceptance angle. It is denoted by ‘αi’.
