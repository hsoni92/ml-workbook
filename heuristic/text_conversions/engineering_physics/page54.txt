  Where ‘c’ is the curie constant and the 𝑇𝑁 is Neel temperature. 
     Ex:  FeO, MnO, Cr2O3  
Ferrimagnetic materials: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
These are the ferromagnetic materials in which 
the magnetic interaction between any two dipoles aligns themselves 
anti parallel to each other. But the magnitudes of any two adjacent 
dipoles are not equal. Therefore, if we apply a small value of 
magnetic field, it will produce a large value of magnetization. 
 
 
 
 
Properties: 
 
1. Susceptibility is positive and very large for these materials. 
2. Spin alignment is systematic, but in anti parallel of different 
magnitudes. 
3. Ferrimagnetic materials possess net magnetic moment. 
4. Above curie temperature becomes paramagnetic while below it 
behaves as  ferrimagnetic material.   
5. Ferrimagnetic domains become magnetic bubbles to act as 
memory elements. 
 
6. Susceptibility is inversely proportional to the temperature. The variation of susceptibility 
with temperature is

Where, C is curie constant and  𝑇𝑁 is Neel temperature. 
 
 
 
 
7. Ferrites are the best examples of ferromagnetic materials. 
8. General formula of ferrites are Me2+OFe2O3 or  Me2+Fe2O4     
Examples: Zn2+Fe2O4, CuFe2O4....... 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
DOMAIN THEORY OF FERROMAGNETISM: 
 
 
 
The concept of domains was proposed by Weiss in order to 
explain the properties of ferromagnetic materials and their 
hysteresis effects.  
Magnetic Domains: Every ferromagnetic material is made of 
a very large number of miniature (very small) regions which 
are known as domains. The boundaries separating the 
domains are called domain walls, also known as Bloch walls.  
In each domain the magnetic dipoles align parallel to each 
other and produce spontaneous magnetization. The direction of spontaneous magnetization 
varies from domain to domain. 
  
Process of Domain magnetization:  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
When the external field is applied there are two possible ways of alignment of random 
domains.  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. By the motion of domain walls.  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
2. By rotation of domains.
