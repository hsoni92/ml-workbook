Bloch Theorem:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
According to free electron model, a conduction electron in metal experiences constant 
potential. But in real crystal, there exists a periodic arrangement of positively charged ions 
through which the electrons move. As a consequence, the potential experienced by electrons is 
not constant but it varies with the periodicity of the lattice.  In zone theory, as per Bloch, 
potential energy of electrons considered as varying potential with respect to lattice ‘a’. 
 
 
 
 
 
    Fig: Variation of potential energy in a periodic lattice. 
Let us examine one dimensional lattice as shown in figure. It consists of array of ionic cores 
along X-axis. A plot of potential V as a function of its position is shown in figure. 
From graph: 
At nuclei or positive ion cores, the potential energy of electron is minimum and in-between 
nuclei, the P.E.is considered as maximum w.r.to. Lattice constant ‘a’. 
This periodic potential V(x) changes with the help of lattice constant a, 𝑉(𝑥) = 𝑉(𝑥+ 𝑎) (‘a’ 
is the periodicity of the lattice)
