 Consider an electric field is applied in the positive x direction then the positive ions 
move to the right by x1 and the negative ions move to left by x2. If we assume, each unit cell 
has one cation and one anion.  
 
The resultant dipole moment per unit cell due to ionic displacement is 
 
 
 
𝜇= 𝑒(𝑥1+𝑥2) 
If β1 and β2 are restoring force constants of cation and anion, Newton is the force due to 
applied field. Then 
 
 
 
𝐹=  𝛽1𝑥1 = 𝛽2𝑥2
 
𝐻𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒,
𝑥1 = 𝐹

Restoring force constants depends upon the mass of the ion and angular frequency of 
the molecule in which the ions are present.

Internal fields in solids [Lorentz Method]:  
Now a dielectric material is placed between the 
two parallel plate capacitor and there be an imaginary 
spherical cavity around the atom ‘A’ inside the 
dielectric. By taking that the radius of the cavity is 
large compared to the radius of the atom. Now, the 
internal field at the atom site ‘A’ can be considered to 
be made up of four components namely E1, E2, E3 and 
E4 
Field E1: - 
E1 is the field intensity at A due to the charge density 
on the plates.From the field theory.  
 
 
 
𝐷= 𝑃+ 𝐸𝜖0
 
∴𝐸1 = 𝑃+ 𝜖0𝐸
𝜖0
∴𝐸1 = 𝐸+ 𝑃

→(1) 
Field E2: - 
E2 is the field intensity at A due to charge density induced on the two sides of the dielectric. 
Therefore, 
 
 
 
𝐸2 = −𝑃
