 It consists of a quartz tube 5 m long and 2.5 cm in the diameter. 
 This discharge tube is filled with gaseous mixture of CO2 (active medium), helium and 
nitrogen with suitable partial pressures.  
 The terminals of the discharge tubes are connected to a D.C power supply. 
 The ends of the discharge tube are fitted with NaCl Brewster windows so that the laser 
light generated will be polarized. 
 Two concave mirrors one fully reflecting and the other partially form an optical 
resonator.

 A mixture of CO2 , N2 and helium or water vapour is used as active medium here. 
 When an electric discharge occurs in the gas, the electrons collide with nitrogen molecules 
and they are raised to excited states. This process is represented by the equation. 
N2 + e* = N2* + e 
N2 = Nitrogen molecule in ground state e* = electron with kinetic energy 
N2* = nitrogen molecule in excited state e= same electron with lesser energy 
 Now N2 molecules in the excited state collide with CO2 atoms in ground state and excite 
to higher electronic, vibrational and rotational levels. This process is represented by the 
equation 
N2* + CO2 = CO2* + N2  
N2* = Nitrogen molecule in excited state.  
CO2 = Carbon dioxide atoms in ground state  
CO2* = Carbon dioxide atoms in excited state 
 N2 = Nitrogen molecule in ground state.
