These photons have same phase and it follows coherence. This phenomenon is called 
stimulated emission 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Stimulated emission rate depends upon the number of atoms available in the 
excitedstate as well as the energy density of photons.

4. The emitted radiation is incoherent. 
5. The emitted radiation is coherent. 
5. The emitted radiation is less intense. 6. The emitted radiation is high intense. 
Light Amplification: 
Light amplification requires stimulated emission exclusively. In practice, absorption 
and spontaneous emission always occur together with stimulated emission. The laser operation 
is achieved when stimulated emission exceeds the other two processes due to its higher 
transitions rates of atomic energy levels.
