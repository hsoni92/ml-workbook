Thus, the diameters of dark rings are proportional to the square root of natural numbers 
and diameters of bright rings are proportional to odd natural numbers. 
Determination of wavelength of a light source: 
Let R be the radius of curvature of a Plano 
convex lens, λ be the wavelength of light used. Let 
Dmand Dn are the diameters of mth and nth dark rings 
are respectively.

The radius R of the Plano convex lens can be obtained with the help of a spherometer. λ 
can be calculated by substituting all the above values. 
DIFFRACTION: 
Introduction: 
The bending of light around the edges of an 
obstacle is called diffraction.  
When light falls on an obstacle then the 
corresponding geometrical shadow on the screen 
should be completely dark. Practically the
