𝑥= 𝑒−𝑏𝑡(𝑝+ 𝑞𝑡) … … . . (4) 
Where p = (𝐴1  + 𝐴2)  𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑞= (𝐴1  −𝐴2) 
Eq.(4) represents a possible form of solution .  
In this equation as‘t’ increases, 𝑒−bt decreases and [p + q t] increases and the damping is said 
to be critical.  
Thus in the case of critical damping, the motion just becomes a periodic or non oscillatory.  
Ex: This type of motion is exhibited by many pointer instruments such as Ammeter, voltmeter, 
etc, in which the pointer moves to the correct position and comes to rest much rapidly without 
any oscillations. 
 
Case III. Under –damped motion: 
 
When  𝑏2 < 𝑤2.In this case √𝑏2 −𝜔2 is imaginary.Let us write √𝑏2 −𝜔2 = i√w2 −b2 = iβ 
where 𝛽= √(w2 −b2) and 𝑖= √−1 
now eq.(3) becomes 𝑥= 𝐴1𝑒(−𝑏+𝑖𝛽)𝑡+ 𝐴2𝑒(−𝑏−𝑖𝛽)𝑡 
= 𝑒−𝑏𝑡 (𝐴1𝑒𝑖𝛽𝑡+ 𝐴2𝑒−𝑖𝛽𝑡) 
= 𝑒−𝑏𝑡 ((𝐴1 cos 𝛽𝑡+ 𝑖sin 𝛽𝑡) + 𝐴2(cos 𝛽𝑡−𝑖sin 𝛽𝑡))  
= 𝑒−𝑏𝑡((𝐴1 + 𝐴2) cos 𝛽𝑡+ 𝑖(𝐴1 −𝐴2)𝑠𝑖𝑛𝛽𝑡)  
= 𝑒−𝑏𝑡 (𝑎sin ∅cos 𝛽𝑡+ 𝑎 𝑐𝑜𝑠∅sin 𝛽𝑡) 
Where 𝑎 𝑠𝑖𝑛 ∅= (𝐴1 + 𝐴2) 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑎cos ∅= 𝑖 (𝐴1 −𝐴2) 
= 𝑒−𝑏𝑡𝑎sin(𝛽𝑡+ ∅) 
𝑥= 𝑎𝑒−𝑏𝑡sin(√(𝑤2 −𝑏2)𝑡+ ∅) 
The above expression is the equation of motion of damped harmonic oscillator. 
The amplitude of the motion continuously decreasing owing to the factor 𝑒−𝑏𝑡 which is called 
damping factor. 
The factor sin(√(𝑤2 −𝑏2)𝑡+ ∅ varies between +1 to -1, therefore the amplitude also varies 
between + 𝑎𝑒−𝑏𝑡 and - 𝑎𝑒−𝑏𝑡.I t is called under damped motion, b is called damping 
coefficient. 
Ex:  Motion of a pendulum in air, the electric oscillations of LCR circuit.
