Field𝑬𝟑:- 
E3is the field intensity at A due to other atoms contained in the cavity. If we assume a 
cubic structure then E3=0 because of symmetry. 
 
Field𝑬𝟒: 
E4 is the field density due to polarization charges on the surface of the cavity and it is 
calculated by Lorentz. The enlarged view of the cavity is shown.  
 
   If dA is the surface area of the sphere of radius r lying between θ and θ+dθ 
 
  
(where θ is the direction with reference to the direction of the applied force)Then𝑑𝐴=
2𝜋(𝑃𝑄)(𝑄𝑅) 
𝑠𝑖𝑛θ = PQ
r => 𝑃𝑄= 𝑟𝑠𝑖𝑛θ 
𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑑θ = QR
r ⟹QR = rdθ 
Hence,       
The charge dq on the surface dA is equal to the 
normal component of the polarization multiplied by 
the surface area.

Field due to this charge at the centre ‘A’ is denoted 
by dE4 and is obtained by imagining a unit charge at 
point ‘A’

Clausius – Mosotti relation: - 
The relation between the dielectric constant and the polarizability of a polarized 
dielectric is known as Clasius – Mosotti equation. Consider the dielectric having cubic 
structure, here there are no ions and permanent dipoles in these materials, the ionic 
polarizability𝛼𝑖 and orientational polarizability 𝛼0 are zero. 
i.e.𝛼𝑖= 𝛼0 = 0
