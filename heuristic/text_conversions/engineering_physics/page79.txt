 They are 
( i) Single mode step-index fiber 
( ii) Multi-mode step-index fiber 
Transmission / propagation of signal in Step-index fibers:  
 Generally the signal is sent through the fiber in digital form i.e. in the form of pulses.  
 The same pulsed signal travels in different paths. 
 Let us now consider a signal pulse travelling through step index fiber in two different 
paths (1) and (2). 
 The pulse (1) travelling along the axis of the fiber and pulse (2) travelling away from 
the axis. 
 At the receiving end only the pulse (1)which travels along the fiber axis reaches first 
while the pulse(2) reaches after some time delay. 
 Hence the pulsed signal received at the other end is broadened. This is called internal 
dispersion. 
 This reduces transmission rate capacity of the signal. 
 This difficulty is overcome by graded index fibers. 
 
2) Graded index optical fiber: 
 In this fiber, the refractive index of the core varies radially.  
 It has maximum refractive index at its centre, 
which gradually falls with increase of radius and 
at the core-cladding interface matches with 
refractive index of cladding. 
 Variation of refractive index of the core with 
radius is given by  
n(x) = 𝑛1[1 −2Δ (

]2 
Where 𝑛1 -> refractive index at the centre of the core 
a-> radius of the core 
Δ-> Fractional index change,∆ =
𝑛1−𝑛2

                         p-> grating profile index number 
 This fiber divided into two types. 
                   ( i ) Single-mode graded index fiber 
( ii ) Multi-mode graded index fiber
