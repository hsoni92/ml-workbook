Concept of effective mass of electron: 
When an electron in a periodic potential of lattice is accelerated by an known electric field or 
magnetic field, then the mass of the electron is called effective mass and is represented by 𝑚∗. 
To explain, let us consider an electron of charge ‘e’ and mass ‘m’ moving inside a crystal 
lattice of electric field E. 
Then by taking known expression F=ma, can be considered here as 𝐹=  𝑚∗𝑎  … … . . (1) 
The acceleration𝑎= 
𝑒𝐸
𝑚is not constant in the periodic lattice but varies due to the change in 
electronic mass. 
If free electron under wave packet, the group velocity Vg corresponding to the particle’s 
velocity can be written as 
𝑣𝑔= 𝑑𝜔

Origin of energy band formation in Solids: 
The band theory of solids explains the formation of energy bands and determines 
whether a solid is a conductor, semiconductor or insulator.
