The CO2 laser produces a beam of infrared light with the principle wavelength bands centering 
around 9.6 and  10.6 µm. 
Principle: The principle of carbon di oxide laser is transition between vibrational states of the 
same electronic states by achieving population inversion between these states.  
For the laser action two points are important ,one is the population inversion  between the two 
levels  and second increased density of the incident radiation. 
Vibrational states in co2 molecules:  
A carbon dioxide molecule has a carbon atom at the centre with two oxygen atoms attached, 
one at both sides. Such a molecule exhibits three independent modes of vibrations. They are 
a) Symmetric stretching mode. 
b) Bending mode 
c) Asymmetric stretching mode. 
 a) Symmetric stretching mode :In this mode of vibration, carbon atoms are at rest and both 
oxygen atoms vibrate simultaneously 
along the axis of the molecule departing 
or approaching the fixed carbon atoms 
 
b)Bending mode: 
  In this mode of vibration, oxygen 
atoms 
and 
carbon 
atoms 
vibrate 
perpendicular to molecular axis. 
. 
 
c)Asymmetric Stretching Mode : 
In this mode of vibration, oxygen atoms 
and carbon atoms vibrate asymmetrically, 
i.e.,   oxygen atoms move in one 
direction while carbon atoms in the other 
direc
