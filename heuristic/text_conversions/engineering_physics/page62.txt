                  According to Boltzmann distribution law                    
 
 
 
 
 
 
     According to Planck’s radiation formula the energy density of photon is given by, 
 
 
                   Comparing eq.(1) & eq.(2), we get 
 
 
 
POPULATION INVERSION: 
The number of atoms present in the excited (or higher) state is greater than the number 
of atoms present in the ground energy state (or lower state) is called population inversion. 
Let us consider two level energy systems of energies E1and E2as shown in figure. Let 
N1 and N2 be the population (means number of atoms per unit volume) of E1and E2 
respectively. 
According to Boltzmann’s distribution the population of an energy level E, at temperature T 
is given by
