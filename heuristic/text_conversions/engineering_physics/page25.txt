Intensity distribution: 
The diffraction pattern consists of central principal 
maximum for α=0. There are subsidiary or secondary maxima of 
decreasing intensity on either sides of it at positions 𝛼=
±
3𝜋
2 , ±
5𝜋
2 .  Between secondary maxima, there are minima at 
positions 𝛼= ±𝜋, ±2𝜋. 
Condition for principal maximum: 
It is clear that intensity to be maximum means 
𝑠𝑖𝑛𝛼
𝛼 should also be  maximum. 
i.e. lim

𝑠𝑖𝑛𝛼

= 1  means R =
