It gives us kinetic energy of an electron. It means zone theory supports classical free electron 
theory at this situation electron completely free electron not bounded with allowed and 
forbidden gaps (and no energy level exists). 
Thus by varying P from 0 to ∞, we find that the completely free electron(s) becomes 
completely bound to Brillouin Zone. 
Brillouin Zone OR E-K diagram: 
The Brillouin zone are the boundaries that are marked by the values of wave vector k,in which 
electrons can have allowed energy values. These represent the allowed values of k of the 
electrons in 1D, 2D,&3D. 
We have ,the energy of the electron in a constant potential box is, 
E = n2h2
8ma2  … . (1)where a = length of the box. 
But, 
𝑘= 𝑛𝜋
𝑎 ⇒𝑘2 = 𝑛2Π2

Substitute eqn (2) in (1) ,we get 
𝐸=

equation. 
A graph is drawn between the 
total energy (E) and the wave 
vector k,for various values of k. 
i.e.𝑘=

It is the energy spectrum of an 
electron moving in presence of a 
periodic potential field and is divided into allowed energy regions (allowed zones) or forbidden 
energy gaps (forbidden zones). 
Allowed energy values lie in the region k=-π/a to =+π/a. This zone is called the first 
Brillouin zone. After a break in the energy values, called forbidden energy band, we have  
another allowed zone spread from k=-π/a to -2π/a and +π/a to +2π/a. This zone is called the 
second Brillouin zone. Similarly, higher Brillouin zones are formed
