Transmission / propagation of signal in Step-index fibers:  
 Let us now consider a signal pulse 
travelling through graded index 
fiber in two different paths (1) and 
(2). 
 The pulse (1) travelling along the 
axis of the fiber though travels along 
shorter route it travels through higher refractive index. 
 The pulse (2) travelling away from the axis undergo refraction and bend as shown in 
fig. though it travels longer distance, it travels along lesser refractive index medium. 
 Hence both the pulses reach the other end simultaneously. 
 Thus the problem of inter model dispersion can be overcome by using graded index 
fibers. 
Based on types of materials: 
   1) glass-glass optical fiber 
   2) glass-plastic optical fiber 
   3) plastic-plastic optical fiber 
ATTENUATION (POWER-LOSS) IN OPTICAL FIBERS 
When light propagates through an optical fiber, then the power of the light at the output end is 
found to be always less than the power launched at the input end. The loss of power is called 
Attenuation. It is measured in terms of decibels per kilometer. 
Attenuation:It is defined as the ratio of the optical power output (Pout) from a fiber of length 
‘L’ to the power input (Pin).

Attenuation occurs because of the following reasons  
(1) Absorption   (2) Scattering loss 3) Bending loss  
(1) Absorption:    
 It occurs in two ways, i)Absorption by impurity or 
impurity absorption 
ii) Intrinsic absorption or internal absorption 
 Impurity absorption: The impurities present in the 
fiber are transition metal ions, such as iron, 
chromium, 
cobalt 
& 
copper. 
During 
signal 
propagation when photons interact with these impurity atoms, then the photons are 
absorbed by atoms. Hence loss occurs in light power.
