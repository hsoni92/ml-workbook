Forced damped harmonic vibrations 
Forced vibrations can be defined as the vibrations in which the body vibrates with a frequency 
other than its natural frequency under the action of an external periodic force. Ex: consider the 
vibrations of bridge under the influence of marching solders, vibrations of a tuning fork when 
exposed to the periodic force of sound waves. 
Equation of motion of forced harmonic oscillator 
The forces acted upon the particle are: 
i) 
A restoring force 
Restoring force is proportional to the displacement but oppositely directed, given by  
f1 α – x  
f1 =  −kx    -------------- (1) 
Where ‘k’ is known as the force constant. 
ii) 
Frictional force 
Frictional force is proportional to velocity but oppositely directed, given by  
f2 α −dx
dt 
f2 = −r (
dx
dt) ------------- (2) 
Where ‘r’ is frictional force per unit velocity. 
iii) 
The external periodic force 
It is represented by  𝑓3 = 𝐹sin 𝑝𝑡   ----------- (3) 
Where F is the maximum value of this force  
So the total force acting on the particle is given by 
Total force = 𝑓1 + 𝑓2 + 𝑓3 
From (1),(2) and (3) 
𝐹𝑜𝑟𝑐𝑒(𝐹) = −kx + −r (dx
dt) + 𝐹sin 𝑝𝑡 
According to Newton second law of motion 
F= mass × acceleration  
𝐹= 𝑚𝑑2𝑥
𝑑𝑡2 
Hence 
𝑚𝑑2𝑥
𝑑𝑡2 = −kx −r (dx
dt) + 𝐹sin 𝑝𝑡 
𝑚𝑑2𝑥
𝑑𝑡2 + kx + r (dx
dt) = 𝐹sin 𝑝𝑡
