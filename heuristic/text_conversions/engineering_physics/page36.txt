Conclusions: 
1. The L.H.S is a cosine term which varies between the limits -1 and +1, and hence the 
R.H.S also varies between these limits. It means energy is restricted within -1 to +1 
only. 
2. If  the energy of 𝑒− lies between -1 to +1, are called allowed energy bands and it is 
shown by shaded portion in energy spectrum. This means that ‘αa’ can take only certain 
range of values belonging to allowed energy band. 
 
3. As the value of αa increases, the width of the allowed energy bands also increases. 
4. If  energy of𝑒−s not lies between -1 to +1 are known as forbidden energy bands and it 
is decreases w.r.to increment of 𝛼𝑎. 
5. Thus, motion of 𝑒−s. in a periodic lattice is characterized by the bands of allowed & 
forbidden energy levels. 
Case 1: 
1. P→∞ 
 If P→∞, the allowed band reduces to a single (line) energy level, gives us steeper lines.
