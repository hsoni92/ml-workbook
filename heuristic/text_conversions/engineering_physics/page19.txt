In the above case, the ray BE is reflected at the surface of a denser medium and hence it 
suffers an additional pathdifference equal to 
𝜆
2. 
The ray BC suffers reflection at C, at the surface of a rarer medium and hence on 
emerging out at D, it suffers no additional path change. 
Hence the net pathdifference between the two reflected rays DF and BE

When the pathdifference is an integral multiple of λ then the rays (1) and (2) will be in

When the pathdifference is half integral multiple of λ, the rays (1) and (2) meet in out 
of phase and undergo destructive interference.
