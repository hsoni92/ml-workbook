   The electric charges +Ze and –Ze are separated by a distance x under the influence of E

2. Ionic – polarization (pi):   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The polarization that occurs due to relative displacement of ions of the molecules in the 
presence of an external electrical field. This happens in solids with ionic bonding which 
automatically have dipoles but which get cancelled due to symmetry of the crystals. Here, 
external field leads to small displacement of ions from their equilibrium positions and hence 
inducing a net dipole moment.  
 Ex:Nacl, KCl or KBrmolecules. 
 It occurs at a frequency of around 1013 Hz. 
 It is a slower process when compared to electronic polarization. 
 It is independent of temperature. 
 
 
 
 
Expression for Ionic polarization of a molecule: 
The ionic polarization is due to the displacement of cation 
and anions in opposite direction and occurs in an ionic solid.
