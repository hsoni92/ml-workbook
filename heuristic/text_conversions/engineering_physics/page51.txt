The magnetic moment contributed by a single electron is known as Bohr Magneton. 
Mathematically it can express as  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
𝜇𝐵= 𝑒ℏ
2𝑚 
Proof: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Let us consider an electron revolving in a circular orbit of radius r with a speed 𝒗 .Consider a  
 
 
pointp on the circle. The electron crosses this point once in every revolution. In one revolution 
the electron travels 2𝜋r distance.  
The current 𝒊 due to the electron motion in the circular loop (orbit) is

Where,T is time for one revolution of electron about the nucleus.

The magnetic moment 𝜇𝑙 associated with the orbit due to orbital motion of electron is  
𝜇𝑙= 𝑖𝐴 
Where, ’𝒊’ is current produced by the orbital motion of the electron and A is area covered by 
the orbital(πr2). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
𝜇𝑙= −𝑒𝑣

Dividing and multiplying above eq. by the mass of the electron
