1. Constructive interference 
2. Destructive interference 
Constructive interference:When the two light waves reach a point in phase the resultant 
displacement (RMax or YMax) is always equal to algebraic sum of individual displacements of 
the light waves. It is known as constructive interference.

Destructive interference:When the two light waves reach a point i.e. out of phase. The 
resultant displacement (RMin or YMin) is always equal to the difference of displacements of the 
light waves. It is known as destructive interference.

Conditions for interference of light: 
      1) The two light sources emitting light waves should be coherent. 
      2) The separation between the two sources should be small. 
      3) The distance between the two sources and the screen should be large. 
      4)  To view interference fringes, the back-ground (good-contrast) should be dark. 
      5)  Amplitudes of two light waves are nearly equal. 
      6)  The source should be mono-chromatic. 
      7)  The sources should be narrow i.e. they must be small. 
 
Interference of reflected lightin thin films: 
When light is incident on a (plane parallel) thin film, 
some portion gets reflected from the upper surface and the 
remaining portion is transmitted into the film. Again, some 
portion of the transmitted light is reflected back into the film by 
lower surface and emerges through the upper surface. These 
reflected light beams superimpose with each other, producing 
interference and forming interference patterns.  
Consider a thin film of thickness‘t’ and refractive index µ. Let a monochromatic light 
ray AB be incident at an angle of incidence of ‘i’ on the upper surface of the film. BE and BC 
are the reflected and transmitted light rays. Let the angle of refraction is ‘r’. The ray BC will be 
reflected into the film and emerge through the film in the form of the light ray DF. 
These two light rays superimpose depending upon pathdifference between them 
producing interference patterns. To know the pathdifference, let us draw the normal DG to BE. 
From D and G onwards, the light rays travel equal distances. By the time the light ray travels 
from B to G, the transmitted light ray has to travel from B to C and C to D.
