Working: 
 When the electric discharge is passing through the gas mixture, the electrons 
accelerated towards the positive electrode. 
  During their passage, they collide with He atoms and excite them into higher levels. 
 F2 and F3 form F1. In higher levels F2 and F3, the life time of He atoms is more. 
 So there is a maximum possibility of energy transfer between He and Ne atoms 
through atomic collisions. 
 When He atoms present in the levels F2 and F3 collide with Ne atoms present ground 
state E1, the Ne atoms gets excitation into higher levels E4 andE6.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Due to the continuous excitation of Ne atoms, we can achieve the population inversion 
between the higher levels E4 (E6) and lower levels E3 (E5). 
 The various transitions E6→ E5, E4→ E3 and E6→ E3 leads to the emission of 
wavelengths 3.39A⁰, 1.15 A⁰ and 6328A0. 
 The first two corresponding to the infrared region while the last wavelength is 
corresponding to the visible region. 
 The Ne atoms present in the E3 level are de-excited into E2 level, by spontaneously 
emission of photon. 
 When a narrow discharge tube is used, the Ne atoms present in the level E2 collide 
with the walls of the tube and get de-excited to ground level E1. 
Uses of He-Ne laser: 
- 
Used in laboratories foe all interferometric experiments. 
- 
Used widely in metrology in surveying, alignment etc. 
- 
Used to read barcodes and He-Ne laser scanners also used for optical character 
recognition. 
- 
Used in holography. 
CO2 laser : 
The CO2 laser was one of the gas laser,these are the highest power continuous wave lasers that 
are currently available,they are also quite efficient .The ratio of output power to pump power 
can be as large as 20%.
