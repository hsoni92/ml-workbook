To solve, by considering Schrodinger’s time independent wave equation in one dimension,

Bloch’s 1D solution for Schrodinger wave equation (1)𝜓𝑘(𝑥) = 𝑢𝑘(𝑥)𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝑖𝑘𝑥) … …… . (2) 
where 𝑢𝑘(𝑥) =  𝑢𝑘(𝑥+ 𝑎) 
Here 𝑢𝑘(𝑥) -periodicity of crystal lattice, modulating function, k- propagation vector =

is plane wave. 
By applying eq.n (2) to eq.n (1),it is not easy to solve Schrodinger wave equation and Bloch 
cannot explains complete physical information about an 𝑒− in periodic potential field. Then  
Kronig Penny model was adopted to explains the electrical properties of an 𝑒−. 
 
Kronig-Penney model: 
Kronig –penny approximated the potentials of an 𝑒−𝑠 inside the crystal in terms of the shapes 
of rectangular steps as shown, i.e. square wells is known as Kronig Penny model.  
i.e. The periodic potential is taken in the form of rectangular one dimensional array of square 
well potentials and it is the best suited to solve Schrodinger wave equation. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It is assumed that the potential energy is zero when x lies between 0 and a, and is considered 
as I region. Potential energy is 𝑉0  , when x lies between –b and 0. And considered as II 
region. 
Boundary conditions:  
𝑉(𝑥) = 0 , 𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝑥 𝑙𝑖𝑒𝑠 𝑏𝑒𝑡𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑛   0 <  𝑥 <  𝑎 –   𝐼 𝑟𝑒𝑔𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑉(𝑥)

This model explains many of the characteristic features of the behavior of electrons in a 
periodic lattice. 
The wave function related to this model may be obtained by solving Schrodinger equations for 
the two regions,
