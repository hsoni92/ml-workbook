Solution of the equation: 
Equation (1) is a differential equation of second degree .Let its solution be 𝑥=
𝐴𝑒𝛼𝑡… … … … … . (2)where A and α arbitrary constants. 
Differentiating equation 2 with respect to t, we get  
dx
dt = 𝐴𝛼𝑒𝛼𝑡          𝑎𝑛𝑑   𝑑2𝑥
𝑑𝑡2 =   𝐴𝛼2𝑒𝛼𝑡 
Substituting these values in eq.(1),we have  
 
𝐴𝛼2𝑒𝛼𝑡+ 2𝑏 𝐴𝛼𝑒𝛼𝑡+ w2𝐴𝑒𝛼𝑡  = 0        
𝐴𝑒𝛼𝑡(𝛼2 + 2𝑏 𝛼+ w2)  = 0     
As 
𝐴𝑒𝛼𝑡 ≠0       ∴  (𝛼2 + 2𝑏 𝛼+ w2)  = 0   
This gives 
𝛼= −𝑏 ± √𝑏2 −𝑤2 
The general solution of eq. (1) is given by  
𝑥= 𝐴1𝑒⌊−𝑏+√𝑏2−𝑤2⌋𝑡+ 𝐴2𝑒⌊−𝑏−√𝑏2−𝑤2⌋𝑡… … … (3) 
 
Where 𝐴1and 𝐴2are arbritrary constants. 
Different damping conditions: 
Case – I, Over damped motion: 
 
When 𝑏2 > 𝜔2. In this case √𝑏2 −𝜔2 is real & less than b. Now the powers in eq. (3) are both 
negative. Thus this displacement x consists of two terms, both dying off exponentially to zero 
without performing any oscillations as shown in figure. 
The rate of decrease of displacement is governed by the term ⌊−𝑏+ √𝑏2 −𝑤2⌋𝑡as the other 
term reduced to zero. 
In this case, the body once displaced returns to its equilibrium position quite slowly without 
performing any oscillation. This type of motion is called as  over damped ordead beat. 
Ex: Motion of simple pendulum moving in thick oil  
a dead beat moving coil galvanometer. 
 
Case II.  Critical damping: 
 
When𝑏2 = 𝜔2,if we put 𝑏2 = 𝑤2  in equation (3) , this solution does not satisfy the differential 
equation(1).  
Let us consider  √𝑏2 −𝜔2  is not zero, but this is equal to a very small quantity ‘h’. 
i.e.√𝑏2 −𝜔2 = h → 0 
Now equation (3) reduces to  
𝑥= 𝐴1𝑒(−𝑏+ℎ)𝑡+ 𝐴2𝑒−(𝑏−ℎ)𝑡 
 
= 𝑒−𝑏𝑡  ⌊𝐴1𝑒ℎ𝑡+ 𝐴2𝑒−ℎ𝑡⌋ 
= 𝑒−𝑏𝑡  [𝐴1(1 + ℎ𝑡+ ⋯. ) + 𝐴2(1 −ℎ𝑡+ ⋯. )] 
 
      = 𝑒−𝑏𝑡[(𝐴1+𝐴2 ) + ℎ𝑡(𝐴1 −𝐴2) + ⋯… ]
