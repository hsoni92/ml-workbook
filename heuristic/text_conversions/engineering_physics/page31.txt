Case I : Probability of occupation at T= 0K,and 𝐸< 𝐸𝐹 
𝐹(𝐸) =
1
1 + exp (
−1
0 )
=
1
1 + 0 = 1 
Therefore F(E) =1,as per above ,clearly indicates that at T=0K, the energy level below the 
Fermi energy level 𝐸𝐹 is fully occupied by electrons leaving the upper level vacant. Therefore, 
there is 100% probability that the electrons to occupy energy level below Fermi level. 
Case II:Probability of occupation at T= 0K, and 𝐸> 𝐸𝐹 
Then 
𝐹(𝐸) = 
1
1 + 𝑒
1
0
= 
1
1 + 𝑒∞=
1
1 + ∞=  1
∞= 0 
i.e., all levels below 𝐸𝐹 are completely filled and al levels above 𝐸𝐹are completely empty. As 
the temperature rises F (E). 
Case III:Probability of occupation at T= 0K, and 𝐸= 𝐸𝐹 
𝐹(𝐸) = 
1
1 + 𝑒0 = 
1
1 + 1 = 1
2 = 0.5 
The above condition states that, T=0K, there is a 50% probability for the electrons to occupy 
Fermi energy. 
The probability function F(E) lies between 0 and 1. 
Hence there are three possible probabilitities namely 
F(E) =1         100% probability to occupy the energy level by electrons. 
F(E) =0         No probability to occupy the energy levels by electrons and hence ,it is empty. 
F(E) =0.5      50%  probability of finding the electron in the energy level. 
Density of States (DOS): 
The number of electrons per unit volume in an energy level at a given temperature is equal to 
the product of density of states (number of energy levels per unit volume) and Fermi Dirac 
distribution function (the probability to find an electron). 
𝑛𝑐= ∫g(𝐸) × 𝑓(𝐸)𝑑𝐸… …….         (1) 
where𝑛𝑐 is the concentration of electrons, g (E) is the 
density of states & F(E) is the occupancy probability. 
The number of energy states with a particular energy value E 
is depending on how many combinations of quantum 
numbers resulting in the same value n. 
To calculate the number of energy states with all possible 
energies, we construct a sphere in 3D- space with ‘n’ as 
radius and every point (nx, ny and nz) in the sphere represents 
an energy state.
