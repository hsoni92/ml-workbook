At the point of contact t =0 the path difference is λ/2, i.e., the reflected light at the point 
of contact suffers phase change of π. Then the incident and reflected rays are out of phase and 
interface destructively. Hence the central spot is dark.

Theory: 
To find the diameters of dark and bright rings, let ‘L’ be the 
lens placed on a glass plate P. The convex surface of the lens is the 
part of spherical surface with centre at ‘C’. Let R be the radius of 
curvature and r be the radius of Newton’s ring corresponding to the 
film thickness‘t’.
