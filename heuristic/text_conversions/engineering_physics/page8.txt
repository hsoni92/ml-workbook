This is known as the differential equation of simple harmonic oscillation. 
Solution using complex exponential method 
The simple harmonic oscillator is  
𝑑2𝑥
𝑑2𝑦+ ω2x = 0 -------- (1) 
Where ω2 = 
k
m 
Let us assume a trail solution of the form 
𝑥= 𝐶𝑒𝛼𝑡 -------- (2) 
Where ‘C’ and ‘α’ are arbitrary constants. 
By differentiating we get  
𝑑𝑥
𝑑𝑡= 𝐶𝛼𝑒𝛼𝑡 
𝑑2𝑥
𝑑2𝑦=  𝐶𝛼2𝑒𝛼𝑡 ------ (3) 
Sub (2),(3) in (1), we get 
𝐶𝛼2𝑒𝛼𝑡+ ω2𝐶𝑒𝛼𝑡= 0 
𝐶𝑒𝛼𝑡(𝛼2 + ω2) = 0 
(𝛼2 + ω2) = 0 
𝛼2 = −ω2 
α = ±iω
