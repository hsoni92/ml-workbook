Resolving power of a grating: 
The resolving power of a grating represents its ability to form separate spectral lines for 
wavelengths very close together. It is measured by  
𝜆
𝑑𝜆 , where d𝜆 is the smallest wavelength 
difference that can just be resolved at wavelength 𝜆. 
Analysis: 
Let a parallel beam of light of two wavelengths 𝜆 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝜆+ 𝑑𝜆 be incident normally on the 
grating .If the nth principal maximum of 𝜆 is formed in the direction 𝜃𝑛,we will have (e +
d) sin θn =  nλ where (e+d) is the grating element. 
Now the grating equation for the minima is 𝑁(𝑒+ 𝑑)𝑠𝑖𝑛 𝜃= 𝑚𝜆  where N is the total number 
of rulings on the grating and m can take all integral values except 0,N,2N,…Nn, because these 
values of m give respective principal maxima.It is clear from figure that the first minimum of 𝜆 
adjacent to nth principal maximum of (𝜆+ 𝑑𝜆) in the direction of increasing 𝜃 will be obtained 
for m= Nn+1.Therefore, for this minimum we have  
𝑁(𝑒+ 𝑑)𝑠𝑖𝑛 (𝜃𝑛+ 𝑑𝜃𝑛) = (𝑛𝑁+ 1)𝜆 
(𝑒+ 𝑑)𝑠𝑖𝑛 (𝜃𝑛+ 𝑑𝜃𝑛) = (𝑛𝑁+ 1
𝑁
)𝜆 
According to Rayleigh criterion, the wavelengths λ and λ+dλ are just resolved by the grating 
when the nth maximum of λ+dλ is also obtained in direction θn+dθn i.e 
(e+d)sin(θn + d θn)=n(λ+dλ)………..(4) 
Figure shows the overlapping of principal maxima of two patterns 
Comparing eqs (3) and(4), we get 
(
𝑛𝑁+1
𝑁) 𝜆= n(λ+dλ) 
nNλ+λ = nNλ+nNdλ 
𝜆𝑑𝜆
⁄
= 𝑛𝑁 
But (
𝜆
𝑑𝜆) is the resolving power R of the grating. Therefore , 
R=nN 
R=
𝑁(𝑒+𝑑) sin 𝜃𝑛
𝜆
 
As expected, the resolving power is zero for the central principal maximum(n=0), all 
wavelengths being indiffracted in this order.
