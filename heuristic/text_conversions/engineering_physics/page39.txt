The existence of continuous bands of allowed energies can be understood starting with 
the atomic scale. The electrons of a single isolated atom occupy atomic orbitals, which form a 
discrete set of energy levels.  
When two identical atoms are brought closer, the outermost orbits of these atoms 
overlap and interact. When the wave functions of the electrons of different atoms begin to 
overlap considerably, the energy levels corresponding to those wave functions split. 
If more atoms are brought together more levels are formed and for a solid of N atoms, 
each of the energy levels of an atom splits into N energy levels. These energy levels are so 
close that they form an almost continuous band. The width of the band depends upon the 
degree of overlap of electrons of adjacent atoms and is largest for the outermost atomic 
electrons. 
As a result of the finite width of the energy bands, gaps are essentially leftover between 
the bands called forbidden energy gap.  
The electrons first occupy the lower energy levels (and are of no importance) then the 
electrons in the higher energy levels are of important to explain electrical properties of solids 
and these are called valence band and conduction band.   
 
 
 
Valence band:A band occupied by valence electrons and is responsible for electrical, thermal 
and optical properties of solids and it is filled at 0K. 
Conduction band: A band corresponding to outer most orbit is called conduction band and is 
the highest energy band and it is completely empty at 0K. 
The forbidden energy gap between valence band conduction band is known as the energy band 
gap. By this solids are classified in to conductors, semiconductors and insulators.
