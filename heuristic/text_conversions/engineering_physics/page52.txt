Here – sign indicates that magnetic moment is anti-parallel to the angular momentum L. 
 
 
CLASSIFICATION OF MAGNETIC MATERIAL: 
Depending on the direction and magnitude of magnetization and also the effect of temperature 
on magnetic properties, all magnetic materials are classified into dia ,para and ferro 
materials.Depending upon the spin orientation of the electrons, ferro magnetic materials are 
classified into two types. They are 
 
 
 
 
 
 
            
a.Antiferro magnetic material. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
b. 
Ferrimagnetic materials.
