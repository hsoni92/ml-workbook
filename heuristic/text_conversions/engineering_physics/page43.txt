polarization(pe). This involves the separation of the centre of the electron cloud around an atom 
with respect to the centre of its nucleus under the application of electric field. 
 It occurs in monoatomic gases like He, Ne, Ar, Xe, Kr 
 It occurs at optical frequencies (1015 Hz) 
 It is independent of temperature. 
Expression for Electronic polarization of a dielectric material: 
 
The displacement 
of the positively charged 
nucleus 
and 
the 
(negative) electron of an 
atom 
in 
opposite 
directions, on application 
of an electric field,  result in electronic polarization. 
On application of external electric field E, the electron cloud around the nucleus readily 
shifts towards the positive end of the field. Because of this, dipole moment is created, within 
each atom due to the separation of positive and negative charges. This separation or shift is 
proportional to field strength (E). 
∴  Dipole moment is the product of charge and the separation between the charges. 
 
 
∴Induced dipole moment  𝜇∝𝐸 
 
 
𝜇= 𝛼𝑒𝐸 
αe is constant of proportionality or electronic polarizability and it is independent of 
temperature. 
Calculation of Electronic polarizability: 
By taking classical model of an atom, the nucleus of change Ze is surrounded by an electron 
cloud of charge –Ze distributed in a sphere of radius R. 
  Then the charge density (Z – atomic number) is given by

𝜋𝑅3) →(1) 
When an external electric field E is applied, the nucleus and electrons experience Lorentz 
forces of magnitude ZeE in opposite direction. Because of this, the nucleus and electron cloud 
are pulled apart. If separation is there in between nucleus and electron cloud, a coulomb force 
develops which is attractive. 
 
When Lorentz and Coulomb force are equal and opposite, equilibrium is reached.   
Let ‘x’ be the displacement under this condition. Here, nucleus is much heavier than the 
electron cloud; it is assumed that only the electron cloud is displaced when the external field is 
applied.
