When light falls on the grating, the light gets diffracted through each slit. As a result, 
both diffraction and interference of diffracted light gets enhanced and forms a diffraction 
pattern. This pattern is known as diffraction spectrum.  
Grating spectrum:

is called grating equation.           
where (e + d) is the grating element and n=1, 2, …... 
Instead of monochromatic source of light such as sodium vapour lamp, if white light 
source such as mercury is used then each diffracted order will have different colours at 
different angles.

Thus in the spectrum for a grating, there is no 
overlapping or mixing of colours unlike the spectrum 
for a prism where different colours overlap. For a 
grating the angle of diffraction (i.e., angular 
dispersion) depends on λ and (e + d). Hence if two 
different gratings of same (e + d) values are chosen, 
they will produce same dispersion and hence they will be identical.
