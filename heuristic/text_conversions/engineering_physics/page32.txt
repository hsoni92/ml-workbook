As every integer represents one energy state, unit volume of this space contains exactly one 
state .Hence; the number of states in any volume is equal to the volume expressed in units of 
cubes of lattice parameters).Also 𝑛2 = 𝑛𝑥

2 + 𝑛𝑧
2Consider a sphere of radius n and another 
sphere of radius n+dn with the energy values are E and (E+dE) respectively.   
 
 
 
 
Therefore, the number of energy states available in the sphere of radius ‘n’ is 
1
8 (4𝜋𝑛3

) 
by considering one octant of the sphere  
(Here, the number of states in a shell of thickness dn at a 
distance ‘n’ in coordinate system formed by 
𝑛𝑥 , 𝑛𝑦 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑛𝑧 and will take only positive values ,in that 
sphere

8 of the volume will satisfy this condition). 
The number of energy states within a sphere of radius 
(n+dn) is 
1
8 (4𝜋

Thus the number of energy states having energy values between E and E+dE is given by 
g(𝐸)𝑑𝐸= 1
8 (4𝜋

8 (4𝜋
