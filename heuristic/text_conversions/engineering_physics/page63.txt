where ‘N0’ is the number of atoms in ground or lower energy states & k is the Boltzmann 
constant. 
From the above equation the population of energy levels E1& E2 are given by 
𝑁1 = 𝑁𝑜𝑒
(−E1
𝑘𝐵𝑇) 
 
𝑁2 = 𝑁𝑜𝑒
(−𝐸2
𝑘𝐵𝑇) 
 
At ordinary conditions N1>N2 i.e., the population in the ground or lower state is always 
greater than the population in the excited or higher states. The stage of making, population of 
higher energy level greater than the population of lower energy level is called population 
inversion i.e., N2>N1. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
METASTABLE STATE:In general the number of excited particles in a system is smaller 
than the non excited particles. The time during which a particle can exist in the ground state is 
unlimited. On the other hand, the particle can remain in the excited state for a limited time 
known as life time. 
The life time of the excited hydrogen atom is of the order of 10-8sec. However there exist such 
excited states in which the life time is greater than 10-8sec. These states are called as Meta 
stable states.  
PUMPING MECHANISMS (OR TECHNIQUES): 
Pumping:  
The process of rising more no of atoms to the excited state by artificial means is called 
pumping. 
A system in which population inversion is achieved is called as an active system. The 
method of raising the particles from lower energy state to higher energy state is called 
pumping. (or the process of achieving of population inversion is called pumping). This can be 
done by number of ways. The most commonly used pumping methods are 
 Optical pumping 
 Electrical discharge pumping 
 Chemical pumping 
 Injection current pumping
