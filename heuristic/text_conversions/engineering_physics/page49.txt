It is a vector quantity.  
Its SI unit is weber m2ortesla
⁄
 and CGS unit is Gauss(= 𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑤𝑒𝑙𝑙𝑐𝑚2
⁄
). 
1Tesla= 104Gauss. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Magnetisingfield(force) or Magnetic intensity(H): The force acting on a unit north pole 
placed at the point. It is independent of the medium.

It is vector quantity. Its SI unit is ampere m.

 Permeability: It`s ability to allow the magnetic lines of force to pass through it or to allow 
itself to be influenced by magnetic field (𝜇).  
 
 
 
 
Relative magnetic permeability(𝝁𝒓):The ratio of its absolute magnetic permeability(µ) of the 
material to the  magnetic permeability of free space (µo). 
 
 
 
 
  
𝜇𝑟= 𝜇

 It is purely a number, it has no units.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
     The permeability of free space or vacuum isµ0 = 4π × 10−7 H m
⁄
. 
 
 
Magnetization: The ability of a material to get magnetized when placed in an external 
magnetic field is called magnetization.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
                     
It is measured by a quantity called intensity of magnetization(I).  
 
 
 
 
The net magnetic dipole moment acquired by a substance per unit volume is 
defined as intensity of magnetization (I). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
I = net magnetic dipole moment of material

It is vector quantity. Its SI unit is  A m
⁄
 .  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Relation between B,H and I: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The flux density B in a material due a to magnetizing force H, as the sum of the flux density 
𝐵0 in vacuum produced by magnetizing force and flux density 𝐵𝑚 due to magnetization of 
material. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Therefore                                𝐵= 𝐵0 + 𝐵𝑚  
 
 
 
 
Also we know that  𝐵0 = 𝜇0𝐻𝑎𝑛𝑑𝐵𝑚= 𝜇0I 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Therefore,                        𝐵= 𝜇0𝐻+ 𝜇0I
