APPLICATIONS OF OPTICAL FIBERS: 
1) Due to high band-width, light can transmit at a higher rate up to 1014 to 1015 Hz. Than radio 
or micro-frequencies. 
2) Long distance signal transmission. 
3) They are used for exchange of information in cable television, space vehicles, sub-marines 
4)  Optical fibers are used in industry in security alarm systems, process control & industrial 
automation. 
5)  They are used in pressure sensors in biomedical & engine control applications.
