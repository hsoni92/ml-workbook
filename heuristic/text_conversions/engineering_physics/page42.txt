Dielectric constant, property of an electrical insulating material (a dielectric) equal to the ratio of 
the capacitance of a capacitor filled with the given material(c) to the capacitance of an 
identical capacitor(co)(in a vacuum without the dielectric material. 
𝜺r  =  𝒄/𝒄𝟎 
(v) Dielectric polarization (p):Diectric polarization or Electric polarization is the induced 
dipole moment (µ) per unit volume (v) of the dielectric in the presence of an electric field.  
 
Electric polarization,slight relative shift of positive and negative electric charge in opposite 
directions within an insulator, or dielectric, induced by an external electrical field.  
 
 
 
 
 
𝑃 =  µ/𝑣 
 
 
 
 
 
Units: c-m-2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If“µ” is the average dipole moment per molecule and “N” is the number of 
molecules per unit volume then 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 𝑃 =  𝑁 µ 
(vi) Dielectric polarisability (α):  
Di-electric polarisability is the net dipole moment induced per unit applied electric 
field. 
𝑃 =  𝑁 µ =  𝑁𝛼𝐸 
Units: F-m2 
(vii)Electric susceptibility (χ):  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It measures the amount of polarization in a given electric field produced in a dielectric. 
Polarization 
proportional 
to 
the 
product 
of 
‘ε0’ 
and 
applied 
electricfield. 
χ = 𝑃/ 𝜀0𝐸 
(viii)Electric flux density or Electric displacement (D):  
 
 
 
 
It is defined as the total number of electric lines of force passing through the dielectric 
material is known as electric flux density (D). 
Mathematically it is represented by the following equation 
                                         𝐷=  𝜀𝐸 +  𝑝 
𝜺𝐸 = 𝜀0𝐸 +  𝑝 
𝜺 = 𝜀0𝜀r 
𝜀0𝜀r𝑬 = 𝜀0𝐸 +  𝑝 
 𝑝= 𝜀0𝐸(𝜀r −𝟏) 
 
Types of polarization in dielectrics: 
There are four types of polarization processes in dielectric. 
1. Electronic –polarization(pe) 
2. Ionic – polarization(pi) 
3. Orientation-polarization or di-polar polarization(po) 
4. Space-charge polarization(ps) 
1.Electronic –polarization(pe)or Atomic Polarization: 
 
 
 
 
 
It is defined as polarization of rare-gas atoms in the presence of a static electric field or 
polarization due to displacement of an electron-cloud from positive charge of nucleus in an 
atom in the presence of an electric field in a dielectric material is known as electronic-
