Uses of Ruby laser: 
- 
Used in distance measurement using ‘pulse echo technique’ 
- 
Used for measurement of plasma properties such as electron density and temperature.  
- 
Used to remove the melanin of the skin.  
- 
Used for recording pulsed holograms.  
- 
Used as target designators and range finders in military. 
Draw backs of Ruby laser: 
- 
It requires high pumping power. 
- 
The efficiency of ruby laser is very small. It is a pulse laser. 
 
He-Ne LASER 
It was discovered by A. Javan & his co-workers in 1960. It is a continuous wave gas laser. It 
consists of mixture of He & Ne in 10:1 ratio as a active medium. 
 
Principle/Characteristics of He-Ne laser: 
This laser is based on the principle of stimulated emission, produced in the He & Ne. The 
population inversion is achieved due to the interaction between He & Ne gases.Using gas 
lasers, we can achieve highly coherent, directional and high monochromatic beam.  
 
Construction: 
 In He-Ne gas laser, the He and Ne gases are taken in the ratio 10:1 in the discharge 
tube.  
 Two reflecting mirrors are fixed on either ends of the discharge tube, in that, one is 
partially reflecting and the other is fully reflecting.  
 In He-Ne laser 80cm length and 1cm diameter discharge tube is generally used.  
 The output power of these lasers depends on the length of the discharge tube and 
pressure of the gas mixture. 
 Energy source of laser is provided by an electrical discharge of around 1000V through 
an anode and cathode at each end of the glass tube.
