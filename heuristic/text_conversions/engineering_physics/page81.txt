 Intrinsic absorption or internal absorption: The fiber itself as a material has a 
tendency to absorb light energy however small it may be. The absorption that takes 
place in fiber material assuming that there are no impurities in it, is called intrinsic 
absorption. 
(II) Scattering loss:  
 When the signals travels in the fiber, the photons may 
be scattered due to variations in the refractive index 
inside the fiber. This scattering is called as Rayleigh 
scattering. It is also a wavelength dependent 
loss.𝑅𝑎𝑦𝑙𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑠𝑐𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠∝

(III)Bending losses:  
 These losses occur due to (a) Macroscopic bending (b) Microscopic bending 
 Macroscopic bending: If the radius of core is large 
compared to fiber diameter causes large curvature at the 
bends. At these bends, the light will not satisfy the 
condition for total internal reflection & light escapes 
out from the fiber. It is called as macroscopic bending. 
 Microscopic bending: These are caused due to non-
uniform pressures created during the cabling of the 
fiber or during the manufacturing the fiber. It causes 
irregular reflections. This lead to loss of light by 
leakage through the fiber. 
OPTICAL FIBER IN COMMUNICATION SYSTEM 
The most important application of optical fibers occurs in the field of communication. 
Fiber optic communication systems comprise of the following units.
