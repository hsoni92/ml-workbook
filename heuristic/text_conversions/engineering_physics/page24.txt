through the slit be focused by means of a convex lens on a screen placed in the focal plane of 
the lens.  
 
According to Huygens-Fresnel, every point on the wavefront in the plane of the slit is a 
source of secondary wavelets, which spread out to the right in all directions. These wavelets 
travelling normal to the slit i.e., along the direction OPo are brought to focus at Po by the lens. 
Thus, Po is a bright central image.  
The secondary wavelets travelling at an angle θ with the normal are focused at a point 
P1 on the screen. Depending on the path difference, the point P1may have maximum or 
minimum intensities. In order to find out intensity at P1, let us draw a parallel AC from A to the 
light ray at B.

Let the width of the slit is divided into ‘n’ equal parts and the amplitude of the wave 
from each part is ‘a’. Then the phase difference between any two successive waves is
