4. It fails to explain Electrical conductivity (perfectly) of semiconductors or insulators. 
5. It fails to give a correct mathematical expression for thermal conductivity. 
6. Ferromagnetism couldn’t be explained by this theory. 
7. Susceptibility has greater theoretical value than the experimental value. 
Quantum free electron theory of metals: 
Advantages: 
1. All the electrons are not present in the ground state at 0 K, but the distribution obeys 
Pauli’s exclusion principle. At 0 K, the highest energy level filled is called Fermi-level. 
2. The potential remains constant throughout the lattice. 
3. Collision of electrons with positive ion cores or other free electrons is independent of 
charges and is elastic in nature. 
4. Energy levels are discrete. 
5. It was successful to explain not only conductivity, but also thermionic emission 
paramagnetism, specific heat. 
Drawbacks: 
1. It fails to explain classification of solids as conductors, semiconductors and insulators. 
Fermi level and Fermi energy: 
The 
distribution 
of 
energy 
states 
in 
a 
semiconductor is explained by Fermi –Dirac 
statistics since it deals with the particles having 
half integral spin like electrons. Consider that the 
assembly of electrons as electron gas which 
behaves like a system of Fermi particles or 
fermions. The Fermions obeying Fermi–Dirac 
statistics i.e., Pouli, s exclusion principle. 
Fermi energy: Itis the energy of state at which the 
probability of electron occupation is ½ at any temperature above 0K. It separates filled energy 
states and unfilled energy states. The highest energy level that can be occupied by an electron 
at 0 K is called Fermi energy level 
Fermi level: It is a level at which the electron probability is 
½ at any temp above 0K (or) always it is 1 or 0 at 0K. 
Therefore, the probability function F(E) of an electron 
occupying an energy level E is given by, 
𝐹(𝐸) =
1
1 + exp (
𝐸−𝐸𝐹
𝐾𝑇)
…… … … … … (1)  
Where 𝐸𝐹  known as Fermi energy and it is constant for a 
system,  
            K is the Boltzmann constant and T is the absolute 
temperature.
