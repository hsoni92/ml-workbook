## Assignment Components

### Part 1: Data Exploration and Preparation (6 marks)

Load your dataset and present descriptive statistics with appropriate visualizations exploring distributions and relationships. Conduct a correlation analysis to understand how variables relate to each other and your target variable. Identify any data quality issues such as missing values and outliers, documenting your decisions on how to handle them. Encode categorical variables if present and describe any feature transformations, providing justification for your preprocessing choices.

### Part 2: Model Development and Validation (10 marks)

Apply appropriate analytical techniques based on your chosen dataset and validate your approach systematically.

#### For Dataset 1: Regression Modeling
Investigate relationships through regression modeling. Examine correlations among predictors and consider dimensionality reduction approaches if needed. Develop multiple models with different predictor combinations or transformations. Compare models using appropriate statistical metrics. Address multicollinearity concerns and identify influential features. Select your best model with clear justification.

#### For Dataset 2: Clustering Analysis
Perform clustering analysis to identify natural customer groupings. Determine the optimal number of clusters. Visualize patterns using dimensionality reduction methods where appropriate. Evaluate the quality of your chosen clustering solution. Document your analytical decisions and present key outputs clearly.

### Part 3: Interpretation and Insights (4 marks)

Interpret your key findings clearly and provide actionable insights. What patterns emerged from your analysis? Discuss the practical implications of your results, acknowledge limitations of your analysis, and provide recommendations based on your findings. Consider what additional data or analysis might strengthen your conclusions.
