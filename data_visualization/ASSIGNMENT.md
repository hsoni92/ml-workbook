Data Visualization and Story Telling course
Assignment [20% of the Course Weight]
Key deliverable of the assignment:
Demonstrate the application of Effective Principles of Visualization Design for designing a dashboard that depicts
change in the voter turnout ratio. [ Key aspects, by Gestlat Principles, Visualization Best Practices, color schema
should be clearly demonstrated]
Data source:
• Election Commission of India ( Link: https://www.eci.gov.in/statistical-reports )
• 2024, 2019, and 2014 [last three General Elections]
• Specific table: PC Wise voter turnout [ e.g. 13.PC Wise Voters Turn Out under 2024]
Assignment Tasks
1. Creation of data set [5 Marks]
Create a data set of select 10 constituencies (of your choice) for the last three general elections
[4 marks will be given for consistency of the data set to support visualization – you should submit this file for
evaluations]
• Variables
o Constituency name
o State
o Total voters with bifurcation of male, female voters
o Total votes polled with bifurcation of male, female voters and postal votes
o Voter turnout ratio – overall, male, female, postal votes
• Identify the variable types [1 Mark]
2. Visualization Development [10 Marks]
Create appropriate visualizations based on aggregated data [e.g. by considering the full or aggregate data for the
select 10 constituencies]
1.
a. Show case change in voter turnout ratio at the aggregate level – over time
b. Show case change in voter turnout ratio at the aggregate level – across genders
c. Show case distribution of voter turnout – across constituencies and across time
d. Show case distribution of voter turnout – across constituencies and genders
3. Dashboard Design [ 5 Marks]
a. Design a dashboard and it should have the four visuals covered in question 2
b. Incorporate drill down or selection feature for showcasing the constituency details
Platform for presenting the dashboard: POWERBI/ Tableau/ Python/ Even Excel is okay (if you can
demonstrate the same) – you must share upload the final file along with the curated data set used for
developing the visualization.
Ensure enabling access for public view if using powerbi / tableau public applications, python (juptyer or
colab file to be shared). All submissions should have the underlying data excel file.
